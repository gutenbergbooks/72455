PREFACE.
</p>

<p>
In the following narrative we have made
use of two entirely distinct anecdotes:
the history of the 'Maids of Taunton'&mdash;which
is a well-known episode in the record of the
Duke of Monmouth's Rebellion&mdash;and the romantic
story of the marriage between Lord Sunderland's
daughter and the Earl of Clancarty.  But although
these incidents have in reality no connection with
each other whatever, we have ventured to combine
the two, and found upon them the adventures of the
young Lord Desmond and Frances Dalrymple.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br><br>
A WET HALF-HOLIDAY.
</h3>

<p>
It was the opinion of Robin Dalrymple that
Mangnall was a humbug.  Such, at least,
was the fact that he announced, in tones
both loud and decided, as he closed a
somewhat battered copy of that author's works with
a tremendous clap, and tossed it contemptuously on
the table.  Lessons were over in the schoolroom at
Horsemandown; and Miss Gregory, at the writing-table
in her own peculiar corner, was doing her best
to be deaf for a few moments to her pupils' clamour,
while she tried to finish a letter in time for the post.
Now the Horsemandown schoolroom was hardly the
place one would choose for the purpose of writing
a letter at any time&mdash;much less at four o'clock in
the afternoon, when the operation of 'clearing away'
was taking place.  Fortunately, however, Miss
Gregory was used to it; and her pen continued to
scratch away valiantly, in spite of the opening and
shutting of drawers, the tumbling of books or slates
on the floor, the heavy bang of the piano lid, and the
uproar of shrill voices that almost drowned the rest of
the clatter around her.  'Yes,' repeated Robin, taking
up a perilous position on the table between two
inkstands: 'Mangnall is a humbug!  Silvia, don't you
agree with me?'
</p>

<p>
But Silvia was busily engaged with a sponge and a
gallipot of water, generally known in the family as
'the schoolroom jam-pot;' and as she never could
answer when appealed to suddenly, she was obliged
to pause in her occupation of washing the slates, and
lean both elbows on the table in order to meditate.
Whereupon Sydney burst in: 'Humbug, of course!
All lessons are humbug, except perhaps geography.
That's the only one that has something like sense in
it.'
</p>

<p>
Robin raised his eyebrows incredulously.  'Sense
in geography!  Why, Syd, if there is a thing that's
utterly abominable and senseless, that's it.  To have
to remember what's the capital of what, and where
rivers "take their source," and to find out the latitude
and longitude of wretched places where one never goes,
and never wants to go!'
</p>

<p>
'But that is the very thing,' said Sydney.  'I do
want to go there; and, what is more, I mean to go
some day when I'm a sailor, and sail round the world.
I want to go to China and India and South America&mdash;Egypt,
of course (not Europe.  I don't care for stupid,
civilised places).'
</p>

<p>
'Oh Syd!' interrupted Silvia's deliberate little voice.
'Not care to see Edinburgh or Rome!  Think of
Horatius.  Don't you care to see places where things
happened long ago, or where celebrated people used
to live?  I did so like going over the Tower last year,
and seeing where the poor little princes were murdered,
and where Sir Walter Raleigh was imprisoned, and
putting my hand on the very same stone that perhaps
his had been on.'
</p>

<p>
'But <i>why</i>?' asked Sydney.  'It makes no difference.
The stone looks just the same, whether he touched it
or not.'
</p>

<p>
Silvia could not tell why.  She could only knit her
brows, and repeat in a meditative tone her favourite
phrase, 'Somehow&mdash;I don't know,' till Sydney grew
tired of waiting for an answer, and began again.
</p>

<p>
'Well, all that I can say is, that I don't care a
farthing for the Tower of London, or Horatius, or Sir
Walter Raleigh, or any of those people.  I never can
remember which is which, or what they did.  I want
to travel, and discover new countries, and fight wild
beasts and savages, and see all sorts of extraordinary
plants and animals, and forests full of poisonous snakes
and fire-flies, and tremendously big ferns, and
humming-birds, and get into all sorts of dangers, and go
where no one has ever been before.  Oh, that would
be glorious!'
</p>

<p>
'Somehow,' began Silvia, rousing herself from a
reverie, and going on rather languidly with her
slate-cleaning duties&mdash;'I don't know&mdash;(well, you needn't
laugh whenever I open my mouth, Sydney).  I mean
to say, I should like to have the "goloshes of fortune."'
</p>

<p>
'What!  Like the people in Robin's fairy-book?'
said little Dolly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes: who always got whatever they wished for,
directly they put the goloshes on.  I should like to
jump back into the Middle Ages, like the old
Professor.'
</p>

<p>
'But you know, Silvia,' Robin remarked, with a very
sagacious look in his round brown eyes: 'you know
how much the Professor hated the Middle Ages when
he got into them.'
</p>

<p>
'That,' rejoined Silvia, 'was because he managed
so badly.  He didn't know he was in the Middle Ages
at all.  I should know where I was, and not be
surprised at everything looking different and odd.  I
should keep wishing myself first in one century and
then in another, I think&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  And only imagine,' said Sydney, 'how Queen
Elizabeth would open her eyes when you told her
about railways, and the penny post, and balloons, and
photographs, and velocipedes!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Syd, I wish you wouldn't!  As if I should tell
her anything about those stupid things!  Of course I
shouldn't talk about what wasn't invented&mdash;then-a-days,'
finished Silvia, after pausing in vain for a suitable
expression.
</p>

<p>
'Well, do you know,' announced Robin, putting his
hands in his pockets, and nodding his head emphatically,
'I think the "goloshes of fortune" would be
awfully wasted on you two.  Such stupid things to
wish!  I know what would be much jollier than
journeying back into the Middle Ages among all those
ridiculous people in Mangnall; or going to places
where one never can find their latitude or longitude.'
</p>

<p>
'My dear Robin,' cried Christie, 'your grammar is
getting perfectly wild.'
</p>

<p>
'Pooh!  Bother grammar.  Because Christie happens
to be twelve, she is always setting-up to be as
clever as Miss Gregory.  As if one could worry one's
self about grammar out of school hours.  Now, Silvia,
I'll tell you where I'd go if I had those goloshes: I'd
go right into fairy-land, and see all the people in the
<i>Arabian Nights</i> and the <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>,
and Hans Andersen's stories.  They would be much
better worth seeing than your Sir Walter Raleighs
and Horatiuses and Syd's savages.  I shouldn't care
to see real people; they would put me so in mind of
Mangnall.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't much like Mangnall,' Silvia confessed.
'But I tell you what: it would be rather nice to be
put into it one's self when one is grown up.  I mean
to write books some day; and then, perhaps, I might
be put into the <i>British Biographies</i>!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh Silvia, and have a portrait like this!' cried
Robin, opening the ill-used book at a page where Miss
Mitford was depicted in company with other worthies,
whose heads had been adorned by Sydney with cocked
hats, and whose eyes had been altered by Robin to a
size and blackness appalling to behold.
</p>

<p>
'Come, boys,' said Christie, after there had been a
general laugh at Silvia's ambition, 'make haste and
finish putting away, and then we'll go and have some
fun in the long garret.'
</p>

<p>
This suggestion cleared the room very speedily; for
the long garret was much esteemed by the young
Dalrymples, on a wet afternoon like the present, as a
capital substitute for the garden or the park.  Here
they had a long and exciting game of hide-and-seek;
and it was not till the autumn afternoon was near its
close, and twilight was gradually creeping on and
filling the corners of the garret with gloom, that Silvia,
the least active of the party, and tired of the sport,
stole away by herself to one of her favourite haunts.
This was the top step of the fine old oak staircase,
which formed one of the chief beauties of the house of
Horsemandown.  From there she could peep through
the carved, twisted bannisters, and watch whatever went
on in the hall below.  Sometimes it was Sir Bernard
Dalrymple's brown setter and Robin's little rough
terrier romping on the mat by the hall door which
engaged her attention; sometimes it was her mother
watering the flowers, that seemed to bloom perpetually
in the sunny hall window; and sometimes it was
Sydney and Christie having one of their most exciting
games of battledore, which were really worth looking
at, so well did they both play.
</p>

<p>
When these amusements failed, and the hall was
deserted, as was the case at present, Silvia found plenty
of companions in the pictures, which covered the walls
around her.  Beyond the fact that they were most of
them portraits of her own ancestors, she knew very
little about them.  But that did not matter, for she
used to find names for them all out of whatever book
she was reading.  These names generally had nothing
to do with their style of dress, which Silvia considered
a matter of no consequence: she only cared for some
imaginary likeness of feature or expression.  Thus, a
tall, thin, dark-eyed gentleman with a Vandyke beard
had been christened by turns 'Hamlet,' 'Prince
Giglio,' or 'Osmond de Centeville,' according to
whether Silvia was absorbed in Lamb's <i>Tales from
Shakespeare</i>, <i>The Rose and the Ring</i>, or <i>The Little
Duke</i>; while a severe-looking dame, with powdered
hair and an unmistakable hoop, did duty with equal
faithfulness for 'The Lady of Branksome Tower,' or
the Witch Aunt in <i>Mrs Leicester's School</i>.
</p>

<p>
On the present occasion Silvia was not left long in
undisturbed possession of her favourite nook, for on
the dispersion of the garret-party she was joined by
Robin; who, after remarking with a yawn that
prisoners'-base indoors was decidedly slow, tried to
get rid of his superfluous energy by sliding down the
bannisters to the bottom of the staircase.  Silvia felt
obliged to put down her book, and watch him as he
climbed slowly up again outside the railing, and felt
much relieved when he appeared at the top.
</p>

<p>
'What book are you poring over now?' he inquired
with some contempt, peeping over his sister's
shoulder.  'History!  Oh Silvia, how can you&mdash;in
play-time?'
</p>

<p>
'It's not history; it's a story,' said Silvia indignantly;
'at least it is just like a story.  And it is so interesting.'
</p>

<p>
'But it's all true?' said Robin, with a face of great
disgust.
</p>

<p>
'Well, it is just as nice as if it wasn't,' replied his
sister.  'And besides, I think I rather like books to
be true, or, at any rate, to think that they might be
true.  I can't think why you hate all the people in
history so, Robin!'
</p>

<p>
'I don't hate them all,' said Robin, after pondering
the subject with a very grave face.  'I like them when
they do something uncommonly jolly; and, besides,
there certainly are some that I want to know about
very much indeed.  One's own relations, I mean.  I
know they are in history books&mdash;that is, some of them:
relations who lived a long time ago.  What do you
call them?'
</p>

<p>
'Ancestors do you mean?' said Silvia.  'I want to
know about them too; for Uncle Algernon once told
me that there were some very curious stories about
the pictures in this house, especially those on the
staircase.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he?' said Robin.  'Then that's what papa
meant when I asked who that boy was.'  (Robin
pointed, as he spoke, to a picture that hung on the
wall opposite.)  'He said I must ask Uncle Algernon,
for he was a namesake of his, and knew all about him.
I always call him "Bluecoat," and I want to know
about him more than any of them.'
</p>

<p>
Silvia surveyed the picture in question with a great
deal of interest.  It represented a boy of about Robin's
age, with dark, bright eyes, handsome features and
chestnut curls, which hung down as low as the rich lace
scarf which was tied round his neck.  He wore lace
ruffles at his wrists, and the blue velvet coat which
had earned him Robin's nickname was adorned with
the most elaborate embroidery.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder when he lived,' said Silvia thoughtfully.
'But, Robin, I should like to know still better about
that little girl next him.  Do you think she is his
sister?'
</p>

<p>
'They are not a bit alike,' pronounced her brother.
'Oh Silvia, she's got regular green sleeves, don't you
see, like that old woman in <i>Granny's Wonderful
Chair</i>?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; I found that out long ago.  I always call her
"Lady Greensleeves,"' replied Silvia.
</p>

<p>
'She is very pretty, I think, in spite of that funny
dress.  But she looks very proud and dignified.'
</p>

<p>
'I suppose she was some grand lady.  How she
stares at one!' added Silvia, hastily turning her eyes
away, but only to meet the gaze of other generations
of Dalrymples, who frowned or smiled on her in all
directions.  'It is very odd that they should look at
one so hard, isn't it?' she said in a half-whisper to
Robin.  'I always notice it, especially when I am
coming up to bed.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied her brother, 'It was Bluecoat staring
at me so, that first made me notice him; and now I
don't mind it a bit, but always nod to him and say
good-night when I come up-stairs.  I wish I knew all
about him.  Now, if we had but the goloshes of
fortune, Silvia, what fun it would be!  We would make
all the pictures tell us their stories.'
</p>

<p>
'How would it be if I was to ask them?' said a voice
just above the children.
</p>

<p>
Silvia started and looked round.  Some one was
leaning over the balustrade in the passage behind
them.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Uncle Algernon!' exclaimed Robin after a
pause of surprise; 'you haven't heard all we have been
saying?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I don't know about <i>all</i>,' said Uncle Algernon,
laughing; 'but I heard about Bluecoat and Lady
Greensleeves and the goloshes of fortune.  So you
want the portraits to tell you their stories, do you,
Silvia?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh Uncle Algernon, do you think us very silly?
But papa says you know their stories.  Do you really?
And how did you find them out?'
</p>

<p>
'How do you know that I haven't a pair of those
goloshes hidden away in that cupboard in my
dressing-room?'
</p>

<p>
'I <i>wish</i> you had!' sighed Silvia, looking wistfully
at Lady Greensleeves' mischievous brown eyes and
rosy smiling mouth.
</p>

<p>
'Well, but if you do know the stories, why shouldn't
you tell them to us?' suggested Robin.  'It would be
almost as jolly as if the pictures were to speak
themselves; wouldn't it, Silvia?'
</p>

<p>
'Not <i>quite</i>, I think,' Silvia said, with a doubtful
glance at Uncle Algernon.  'You see, it would be so
nice to hear all that they used to think, and how
Horsemandown looked in those days,&mdash;all in their
own words, you know, Robin.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, but then they would talk in an old way, like
the people in history books,&mdash;"hath," and "natheless,"
and "by my halidome."  I can't bear coming to those
kind of words in Mrs. Markham.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, Silvia, what do you say to this?' said Uncle
Algernon after a moment's silence, during which he
had seated himself between his nephew and niece on
the broad step.  'Lady Greensleeves and I are very old
friends.  I am going to take down her portrait to-night
and clean it in my dressing-room.  Now, suppose I
were to ask her, as a very particular favour, to tell her
story to you and Robin in her own words.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh uncle!' cried both children at once; 'how
delightful!  Will you really?  But what do you mean?
How can she, in her own words?'
</p>

<p>
'Never mind,' quoth Uncle Algernon, nodding
significantly.  'As I said before, she is a very old
friend of mine, and I have a strong persuasion that
she won't refuse me this; besides, you forget the
goloshes of fortune.  Nothing can be refused to one,
you know, when one has those goloshes on.'
</p>

<p>
'But, uncle, how can you make her tell it us?'
</p>

<p>
'Never mind,' said Uncle Algernon again, 'you will
see all in good time.  Only come to my dressing-room
to-morrow when lessons are finished,&mdash;you and Robin,
nobody else,&mdash;and I'll tell you what comes of my
interview with her ladyship.'
</p>

<p>
The dinner-bell rang at this moment, whereupon
Uncle Algernon jumped up and beat a hasty retreat
into the said dressing-room.
</p>

<p>
'How does he mean to do it?' asked Silvia, after
pondering for a whole minute without speaking.
</p>

<p>
'I don't know, I can't think, unless he means to
write a story about her.  You know he does write
books; so perhaps&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
But at this juncture the discussion came to an end,
for the lamp blazed up in the hall below, and Christie
came rushing along the gallery, crying, 'Silvia, Robin,
have you really been sitting here in the dark all this
time?  Why, the tea-bell rang a quarter of an hour
ago.  There are muffins; and Sydney is eating all
the blackberry jam!'
</p>

<p>
The next morning Lady Greensleeves had disappeared
from the staircase.  Uncle Algernon had a
passion for cleaning oil-paintings, and one or other of
the family portraits was always to be found in his room
whenever he came to stay at Horsemandown.
</p>

<p>
Not a moment was lost by Robin and Silvia when
four o'clock struck that afternoon, and lessons were
over, in rushing to the bright, pleasant room which was
always called Uncle Algernon's dressing-room, and
held sacred to him, even when he was away on his
travels on the other side of the world.
</p>

<p>
There he sat in the midst of his books and drawings,
and cases of stuffed birds and curiosities, brought from
all parts of the globe.  He was in a big arm-chair on
one side of the fire-place, and the sofa was drawn up
on the other.  The portrait of Lady Greensleeves was
in the room too, looking much fresher and brighter than
she had done ever since the children could remember.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Silvia, here we are, you see, both at your
service,' said Uncle Algernon as they entered.  'Make
yourselves comfortable on the sofa; only, first allow
me to introduce you to her ladyship, Frances Countess
of Desmond, the wife of your old friend Bluecoat; or
rather, to give him his proper name and title, Algernon
Carey Earl of Desmond.'
</p>

<p>
'His wife!' ejaculated Robin, staring with a puzzled
air, first at Uncle Algernon, and then at Lady
Greensleeves' picture.  'But she is a little girl!'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Robin,' said Silvia reproachfully, 'don't you
know people used to marry when they were children
long ago?  Don't you remember about Jeanne
D'Albret?'
</p>

<p>
'Used they?' asked Robin vaguely.  'Oh well, I
never remember about people in history, so I daresay
they did.  But, Uncle Algernon, I thought Lady
Greensleeves was an ancestor of ours, and that her
name was Dalrymple?'
</p>

<p>
'So it was, before she married,' replied his uncle.
'But you shall hear all about it if you will sit down
and listen.  She has graciously consented to your
wish, that she should tell you her history in her own
words, but&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Uncle Algernon!  Not really.  I can't believe
it.  What do you mean?' cried Silvia, jumping upon
her uncle's knee and putting both hands on his
shoulders, while she gazed into his eyes to see if he
were laughing or not.
</p>

<p>
'Are you in fun, Uncle Algernon?' said Robin,
looking doubtfully from his uncle to Lady Greensleeves.
</p>

<p>
'No, indeed I am quite in earnest.  Lady Greensleeves
is going to tell you her history, only through
me; for, you see, she only condescends to speak
directly to a very old intimate friend like myself; so
she has dictated it to me, and I will tell it in her own
words exactly as she said it.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I understand!' exclaimed Robin, clapping his
hands.  'It will be an <i>I</i> story, you know, Silvia&mdash;as
if she had written it herself, like Robinson Crusoe.'
</p>

<p>
'Exactly,' said Uncle Algernon, laughing.  'And at
my special request she has addressed it to you and
Silvia, and has kindly consented to bring in as little
of "natheless" and "by my halidome" and "in good
sooth" as she can possibly help.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, thank you, Uncle Algernon, how nice it will
be!  Please go on.'
</p>

<p>
And with Silvia on his knee, and Robin on the sofa
opposite, Uncle Algernon began the story of Lady
Greensleeves.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br><br>
LADY GREENSLEEVES' STORY.
</h3>

<p>
In the year 1674 (nearly two hundred years
ago, my dears), I was born in this house.
My name, as you now know, was not Lady
Greensleeves or Lady anything then, but
plain Mistress Frances Dalrymple.  My father, Sir
Bernard, was the third baronet of our house.  You
know his portrait in the mulberry-coloured coat and
fair periwig over the dining-room chimney-piece; my
mother's hangs opposite, just as it did when I first
remember it.  Well, as I said just now, I was born in
this house, and till I was ten years old I never left
it for a single night.  You know we could not rush
about in my time as you do now: as for going to the
sea-side in the summer, such an idea never entered
our heads.  I suppose we were stronger than you
modern people.  At all events, doctors never ordered
us change of air; and we did very well without it.
Besides, we didn't care much about the sea in those
days.  I daresay you would hardly believe me if I
told you that I never even saw it till I was past
twenty, and then the sight was anything but pleasant
to me.  But this was the fact, nevertheless; and I do
not think it ever occurred to any of us that we should
like to stay by the shore and build castles in the sand,
and hunt for shells and pebbles, as children do in these
days.
</p>

<p>
'I was very happy here at Horsemandown running
about with my three brothers&mdash;playing with the dogs,
and attending to our chickens, our tame animals, our
hawks, and goats, and rabbits.  Ah, those were merry
days!  (jolly, I suppose <i>you</i> would say).  Such games
of hide-and-seek we used to have in the garden and
park!  There were about three times as many trees
in the park in those days: one old hollow oak there
was, a splendid hiding-place, but in which nobody
ever thought of hiding, because it was always there
that the seekers first came to search.  Old Shad
(Shadrach was his proper name), my father's falconer,
used to call it Merlin's Oak.  He knew an endless
stock of stories about King Arthur and his knights, and
Merlin, and all those people; and we used firmly to
believe that King Arthur lived at Horsemandown, and
that the great table inlaid with brass in my mother's
grand withdrawing-room must have been the original
round-table.  As to Merlin, old Shad had not the
smallest doubt that he was charmed to sleep in our
favourite oak, and we thought of course that Shad
knew all about it.  I remember little Roger, the
youngest of us all, asking Shad if he had ever been out
hawking with King Arthur.  Roger had very odd ideas
about age.  He thought nobody ever had been, or ever
could be, older than Shad; and told Mrs. Rebecca, my
mother's tirewoman (I beg your pardon, lady's-maid),
that she was what he considered an elderly person.  If
she had been thirty-two instead of twenty-two, I don't
think she would have laughed till she cried, or have
taken the pains to chase Roger round the room for
a kiss.  My brothers were all younger than myself.
Oliver came next to me.  Poor Oliver, how fond I
was of him!  But so indeed I was of Miles and Roger.
The same tutor taught us all; and the only lesson
that I had apart from them was needlework.  That
hour which I spent every morning, doing silk
embroidery under my mother's superintendence, was the
time that I hated more than all the rest of the day.
My mother was very skilful in this obnoxious
embroidery, and indeed in all kinds of work; but in other
respects she was not an accomplished woman.  So,
as she and our tutor, Master Waynefleet, were my
only teachers till I was more than ten years old, I
could neither dance nor sing, nor play upon the harp,
as a well-educated young lady ought to have done.
I don't think my mother considered these accomplishments
necessary.  At all events, she did not take my
ignorance then much to heart.  My father would
sometimes look at me with a doubtful, critical sort of
expression, and ask me an abrupt question, generally
about my studies; sometimes he would inquire what
I had been doing with myself all day, and my answers
never seemed to please him.  He would raise his
eyebrows, and give a peculiar whistle, or a short laugh,
which always made me feel very uncomfortable, and
very much ashamed of myself, though I did not exactly
know why.  However, it was not very often that this
happened, for I saw very little of my father; and, to
say the truth, this did not much distress me.  Children
in these days can have no idea how dreadfully afraid
of him I used to be; and yet I was by no means a
shy or timid child.  Rather the contrary.  I was not
afraid of my mother, nor of Master Nicholas Waynefleet;
though I certainly never dreamed of treating
him in the familiar way that you would treat your
elders now-a-days.  Not that I should have been any
better if I had been born in this century.  Dear me,
no!  I should probably have been the most pert and
disrespectful of you all; but when I try to imagine
myself romping with my father, and asking him
questions, or answering him, as you do your papa and
mamma, it really makes me quite cold and shaky.
Ah! even mamma, though I loved her with all my
heart (and no mother could be fonder of her daughter
than she was of me), would have been rather astonished
if I had plunged into her arms and given her one of
those rough, unceremonious hugs and kisses that I so
often see inflicted on the present Lady Dalrymple of
Horsemandown.  Why, she always taught me to
courtesy when I entered or left a room, even if no one
was there but herself; and I very seldom called her
anything but madam.  I daresay this seems frightfully
cold and stiff to you, but it was as natural to me as it
is to you to address your governess as "Miss Gregory,"
instead of using her Christian name.  Mamma and I
were a good deal together.  I being the only girl, and
papa being very seldom at home, I was her only
companion, and my time was spent pretty equally between
her and my brothers.  My father, as I have said, was
not often at Horsemandown.  Some part of the year
he was, of course, obliged to be in London to attend
Parliament; but at other times he would be constantly
away from home.  He was a good deal at the court;
for my father was a great favourite of King Charles
II., and both he and my grandfather had been among
those gentlemen who were sent over to Holland to
bring home the King at the Restoration in 1660.  He
never took my mother with him either to London or
to the court, and I do not think she had any more
wish to go than he had to take her.  His whole mind
was wrapped up in politics, and she took not the
slightest interest in them; neither did she care for the
court and its gaieties.  She used to tell me that she
had had enough of court life when she first married,
and hoped that, if ever I did go to Whitehall, I might
be as glad to leave it as she had been.  All her interest
now was in me and my brothers, and in the affairs of
the household and estate.  She was an extremely
brisk, active person, always busied about something.
I was very proud of helping her in the garden, the
still-room, and the kitchen; for she always
superintended the making of preserves, pickles, and
home-made wines, etc.  We used to go about the garden
together, cutting off the dead roses, gathering saffron,
lavender, and camomile flowers, and spreading them
out to dry in the sunny window-seats of the still-room,&mdash;into
the dairy to watch the four apple-cheeked dairy-maids
churning away at the butter, and pressing the
cheese; and we used to attend to the poultry too;
and to the bees; and to walk to any cottage on the
estate where a sick person had been heard of,
carrying sundry draughts, compounded by my mother's
own hand.  Well!  I always like to remember those
days.  I think they were the best, or if not <i>quite</i> the
best, at least they were some of the happiest days of
my life.  However, I daresay you would rather hear
about my unhappiest days.  That quiet, comfortable
kind of life that one really enjoys most one's self, is
not half so amusing to other people as one's misfortunes;
but I am coming to a more interesting part of
my story now.  One morning (it was in December
1684, when I was between ten and eleven years old)
Oliver and I were going out hunting with old Shad.
He had begun to teach us to ride, almost before we
could walk; and I must say I think we did him great
credit.  This was the first winter we had been ever
allowed to hunt.  Mamma had long given it up, though
she was an excellent horsewoman.  She had no time
for it now, she said; but she never minded trusting us
to Shad's care.  And, after every gallop across country,
Oliver and I used to nearly tease the life out of the
poor old fellow till he promised to take us again.  It
was a fresh wind this morning, with some bursts of
sunshine from time to time, as the clouds flew across
the sky.  Oliver and I would insist on racing one
another through the park, heedless of poor Shad, who
jogged behind at a sober pace, shouting to us imploringly
not to tire the horses so early in the day.  We
were flying along in this way, both in mad spirits,
down a rough, winding lane that skirted the park,
both bent upon seeing who should first leap a little
brook that crossed the path, when suddenly what
should appear running towards us but a rough grey
Irish staghound, the sight of which made Oliver
exclaim, "Larry! and my father!"  When his master
went from home, Larry was seldom left behind.  They
both had been away for more than a month, staying
with Sir Harry Mountfort at New Court, and my
father had sent us no notice of his intended return.
Oliver, when he saw Larry followed by two mounted
figures advancing very carefully and deliberately over
the stones and ruts of the narrow lane, immediately
turned and trotted back to the side of the ill-used Shad,
and I had a strong inclination to do the same; but
my little mare Hebe was going at a pace somewhat
too headlong to be checked in a moment, and I was
over the brook almost before I had time to think about
it.  I had shot right between the two horsemen before
I could pull up, and was not surprised to hear a loud
exclamation of mingled wrath and astonishment as I
flew past.  A <i>very</i> strong exclamation it was,&mdash;not
quite what your papa would like his little girl to hear;
but gentlemen in those times were not scrupulous as
to their language, even before their wives and daughters.
When at length I managed to bring Mrs. Hebe to a
standstill, my father had dismounted, and striding up
to me, took hold of the bridle and turned her head.
Not a word did he say to me till he had examined
Hebe all over with an anxious and critical eye; then,
patting her glossy neck soothingly, he turned his mind
to me.  I suppose I looked in a terrible fright.  I
certainly felt as if my cheeks were crimson, and my
hands shook so that I dropped the reins.  My father
put them into my hand again with one of his
sarcastic laughs, and then asked, less angrily than I
expected:
</p>

<p>
'"And now, Mistress Frances, where might you be
going to in such a hurry?"
</p>

<p>
'"We were going out with Mr. Atherley's hounds,"
I faltered out, finding it very hard to keep from
bursting into tears.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, indeed!  Are you in the habit of following
Mr. Atherley's hounds all by yourself?"
</p>

<p>
'"No, sir; Shad is taking me and Oliver.  We have
only been once before."  And as I spoke, I saw, to
my great relief, Shad and my brother emerging from
a bend in the lane.
</p>

<p>
'"And pray, what does Shad mean by letting you
start at this break-neck pace, and down this lane too,&mdash;full
of holes like fish-pools, and flints as sharp as the
point of my rapier?  Out upon him!  If you had
thrown down Hebe!  That old fool Shad shall be
taken to account for this."
</p>

<p>
'In spite of the awe that I felt for my father, I could
not sit silently and hear dear old Shad abused,
especially when I knew my brother and I were alone to
blame with regard to the "break-neck pace."
</p>

<p>
'"Indeed, sir," I cried eagerly, "it was not Shad's
fault at all.  He called to us the whole way not to
gallop; but we wouldn't stop, because we wanted to
run races."
</p>

<p>
'"Faith! but she's a spirited little damsel," said my
father's companion, laughing.  "Come, Dalrymple, as
Hebe's knees, luckily, are not broken, you must
forgive her this time.  You won't have the trouble of
keeping her in order much longer, you know.  It will
be somebody else's business to scold her soon."
</p>

<p>
'Somebody else!  What could he mean?  I dared
not ask, for he had not spoken to me; so I could only
glance curiously, first at him, then at my father.
There was not much to be gathered from their faces,
however.  That of the latter was stern, and a little
anxious, while his friend's expressed nothing but
amusement.
</p>

<p>
'"There, there!  A truce to that for the present,
Mountfort," my father said as he caught my eye.
"As you say, Hebe's knees are, luckily, not broken&mdash;(no
thanks to her mistress, though); so we will say no
more about it now.  Frances, this is my friend, Sir
Harry Mountfort.  Give him your hand; and don't
look sheepish, like a little country maiden who has
never seen a gentleman in her life before."
</p>

<p>
'Now, however sheepish one may feel, one does not
like to be called so before a stranger; so I held up my
head, and made a tremendous effort to look dignified
and self-possessed, as became Mistress Frances
Dalrymple of Horsemandown.  Sir Harry shook hands
good-naturedly; asked me about my hunting; said I
sat my horse admirably, and wished me a good day's
sport; but I could hardly answer him properly, because
I was trying all the time to hear what my father was
saying to Shad and Oliver.  He did not take Shad to
task, as he had threatened to do, but merely told him
to go on with Oliver, and to take the horses gently
down the lane.  But what was my dismay when he
said, "Mistress Frances will not hunt this morning.  I
shall take her home with me!"  I really could not keep
the tears out of my eyes this time, it was such a terrible
disappointment.  I looked ruefully at Sir Harry, with
a faint hope that he might remonstrate on my behalf,
as he had done before.  But no: he evidently did not
mean to do any such thing; so I was obliged to keep
my vexation to myself, and watch Shad and Oliver
with longing eyes, as they vanished from view down
the lane.  I could not understand whether my father
was still angry with me or not, but thought he must
have put a stop to my hunting as a punishment for my
carelessness in risking Hebe's knees.  What other
reason he could have, I tried in vain to imagine.  He
had never before cared to have me with him,&mdash;never
before introduced me to any of the friends who from
time to time he brought to Horsemandown.  At all
events, whatever his motive might be, I thought it
very hard to be obliged to ride soberly home by my
father's side, when I might have been galloping over
the fields, leaping hedges and ditches,&mdash;chattering at
my ease to Oliver, with no one to control us but poor,
dear, old Shad, who let us do almost anything we
chose; and whom in return, I am afraid, we teased
without mercy.  We rode slowly back up the lane,
and through the park; and though I kept on crying
to myself, I contrived to choke back the sobs that
rose in my throat.  But tears would roll faster and
faster down my cheeks.  I thought of my last day's
hunting, when I had outstripped all the ladies of the
party, not to mention Oliver and Shad,&mdash;when the
master of the hounds had praised my horsemanship,
and I had struck Miles and Roger with awe and
admiration by bringing home the brush in my hat.
How proud I was of my exploits that day! and how
much I had been bent upon gaining even more praise
this morning!  Dear me!  I am afraid I must have
been a vain little girl in those days, and a very foolish
one too, to make such a fuss about a little disappointment.
A year later I had learned to be wiser; for
the more of the world we see, the less important we
think ourselves; and when once we know by experience
what real trouble is, little everyday vexations
seem much easier to bear.  For some time my father
and Sir Harry were too much wrapped up in their
own conversation to take any notice of me or my tears.
I daresay I should have listened too, and forgotten my
grievance, if I could have understood what they were
saying; but, unfortunately, they spoke French;
and though I used to read French and make translations
every day with Master Waynefleet, that was
quite a different thing to being able to follow it when
people chose to speak in very fast and eager undertones.
Now and then I caught my own name, but
that only made me feel more aggrieved at not
understanding anything else.  So I cried on like a silly
child, "because I'd nothing else to do" (as that Irish
song says, that Christie is always singing when she
goes up and down stairs).  At last Sir Harry turned
his head to ask me whether I thought mamma would
give him a night's lodging, and looked somewhat
astonished at the sight of my dolorous face.
</p>

<p>
'"Why, Dalrymple!" cried he; "here's a melancholy
state of things.  Your daughter is weeping out
those bright eyes of hers, by way of giving us a
welcome to Horsemandown."
</p>

<p>
'"What's the matter now, Frances?"
</p>

<p>
'My father's glance of cold surprise, and the tone
of annoyance with which he asked this, checked my
tears in a moment.
</p>

<p>
'"Well!" he repeated when I hesitated, thoroughly
ashamed of having behaved so childishly before a
stranger.  "Oh, is that all?" he said when I murmured
something about hunting; and he looked at Sir
Harry with a laugh, and an expressive shrug of the
shoulders.  "Don't be a baby, child!  I expected to
find you more of a woman."
</p>

<p>
'This was humiliating.  I would have given up two
or three days' hunting now not to have cried.
</p>

<p>
'"Never mind, Mistress Frances," said good-natured
Sir Harry; "you can go a-hunting when I am gone,
you know.  I shall be off to-morrow morning, so you
only have to-day to make my acquaintance; and you
and I are going to be great friends, I am sure."  And
so we were, before many minutes had passed.  My
tears dried in the wind, and in a little while I found
myself talking and laughing with Sir Harry Mountfort
as if I had known him all my life, and much more at
my ease then I had ever ventured to be with my father.
Sir Harry asked me all sorts of questions, paid me all
sorts of compliments, and said the most absurd things
with the gravest of faces; and my father, too, talked
more pleasantly than he had ever talked to me before,
and laughed at his friend's ridiculous speeches as much
as I did myself.  I began to think Sir Harry the
kindest man I had ever seen, and yet every now and
then there was something in his eyes that gave me a
suspicion that he was what Robin would call "chaffing
me."  All the time, I had a vague sort of feeling
that my mother would dislike him, though I could not
feel sure why.  As we rode up to the house, Miles and
Roger came tearing out of the poultry-yard to see who
we were, but, upon closer inspection, tore back again,
and, by the time we had dismounted, reappeared
walking demurely one on each side of mamma, who wore
her great black garden hood, and had her apron filled
with eggs.  However she was dressed, mamma could
not look anything but a thorough lady, and a very
beautiful woman too; still my father, as he greeted
her and introduced Sir Harry Mountfort, was evidently
a little bit distressed at her costume, and, I could see,
was particularly scandalized at the exhibition of the
eggs.  "So you have brought back Frances!" she said,
looking anxiously at my face, which still showed signs
of my crying fit.
</p>

<p>
'"Nothing has happened?  She has had no accident
with Hebe?"
</p>

<p>
'"No, sweetheart," replied my father, with a tinge
of impatience in his voice; "I wanted the child at
home to-day.  Surely when I come home, after being
absent for so long, my daughter might be content to
spend a few hours with me without grudging."  Then,
as I ran away to change my habit and tell my adventures
to the boys, I heard him add in a lower key:
"I must have a little conversation with you about
Frances, Sir Harry and I have&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'The rest of the sentence I lost, but I had heard
enough to throw me into a state of extreme curiosity
and excitement.  Something must be going to happen
to me,&mdash;there could be no doubt about that; but was
it to be something agreeable or disagreeable?  I felt
half frightened, yet at the same time in tremendously
high spirits, as I pondered over this mysterious something,
and made all sorts of wild guesses as to what it
could be.  How I longed for Oliver to come home,
that I might talk it over with him!  But I knew he
would not return till late in the afternoon; and Miles
and Roger were so little.  Besides, Roger was always
making odd remarks, and saying just the thing one
did not want him to say.  There was no telling what
he might repeat before Sir Harry or my father; for
Roger never knew what it was to be afraid of anybody,
and he had a way of looking at you solemnly, with
his head first on one side and then on the other, and
then coming out suddenly, in his slow grave voice,
with some observation that from any of the rest of
us would have sounded most impertinent, but which,
from him, only sent people into fits of laughter.  No! it
would not do, I decided, to consult Miles and Roger.
I must keep my conjectures to myself till I could be
alone with mamma.  She might perhaps tell me
something, if there was anything to tell.  I saw
nothing of her, however, till dinner, which was in the
middle of the day, not at eight o'clock in the evening:
that was our supper-hour.  We generally dined all
together, even when my father was at home; but now
that Sir Harry was in the house, I was rather afraid
that we should be condemned to have dinner in the
nursery.  That might be all very well for the little
boys; but for me, the eldest of the family, mamma's
companion, to be classed with them, would be too
humiliating.  So I fussed and fidgeted, snapped at my
brothers, and made nurse quite angry, and good-humoured
Rebecca almost cross, by perpetually teasing
them to know whether they thought I should be
allowed to dine down-stairs.  At length a man's step
was heard on the staircase, and, when the door opened,
who should be seen but my father!  Nurse jumped
up as if she thought the house must be on fire;
Rebecca upset her work-basket and knocked down the
fire-irons; and Miles and I stopped in the middle of
a furious quarrel about a drum, which he wanted to
turn into a cage for dormice.  No wonder my father
created such a sensation in the nursery; for never
before had he been seen there, since I could remember,
except once, when Oliver had swallowed a bullet, and
was supposed to be dying.  "Come down with me,
Frances," said he, not deigning to observe the
commotion he had excited.  He held out his hand, and I
sprang towards him, casting a triumphant glance at
Miles and Roger as I did so.  But my father, instead
of taking me at once down-stairs, surveyed me all over
so critically that I hung down my head and blushed
crimson, painfully conscious of a large hole recently
torn in my dress, and of hair which might have been
brushed that morning, but which looked as if it had
not been touched for a week.
</p>

<p>
'"Go and tell nurse to make you fit to be seen,
child," said he in his usual cold, measured tones; "and
then you can come with me."
</p>

<p>
'Of course nurse was excessively elaborate in her
proceedings after this injunction.  I thought she never
would have done combing and curling my unfortunate
locks, or arranging and smoothing each plait and fold
of my best dress.  But at last it was over, and I
suppose the result was satisfactory; for though my
father led me away without a word, Sir Harry Mountfort
turned to my mother when we entered the dining-room,
and said something about "a sweet little bride,"
and "hoping to see a coronet on those pretty dark
tresses,"&mdash;remarks which, while they puzzled me
exceedingly, caused me to hold up my head and colour
with surprise and pleasure.
</p>

<p>
'I had never heard so many compliments before,
and felt rather vexed that mamma only smiled very
faintly, and immediately began to talk about something
else&mdash;about a certain Earl Desmond, in whom both
she and my father appeared to be greatly interested,
though I, who had never heard his name before, could
not care about him.  So I let my thoughts wander off
to all kinds of subjects.  I wondered what sort of a
day's sport Oliver and Shad were having,&mdash;whether
Hebe was as sorry as I was, to be cheated of her day
with the hounds; and then I wondered afresh what
Sir Harry's mysterious words could mean.  Perhaps
it would be as well to listen to what was going on, in
case I might be able to glean something from the
conversation about myself.  So I turned my eyes away
with an effort from the sunny slope of green, swelling
down, on which they were gazing (you know the view
from the window of the oak parlour), and fixed them
on Sir Harry just as he was saying:
</p>

<p>
'"Ah, your daughter will have a splendid position
at court one day, I doubt not, madam.  The Earl of
Desmond's ancient title and large estates must give
him a good deal of political influence, even if he does
not turn out, as I think he will, a man with a pretty
strong character of his own."
</p>

<p>
'The Earl of Desmond still!  But what could he
have to do with me?  And how, oh how, was I to
have a splendid position at court through his means?
I did not dare to ask, as one of you would have done;
for to speak in the company of one's elders, without
being spoken to, was a proceeding unthought of in
those days.  I could only glance from Sir Harry's to
my mother's face, and then for the first time I noticed
how sad and anxious it looked.  Her eyes, too, had
a red rim round them, as if she had been crying.
What could be the reason?
</p>

<p>
'"That she may be good and happy, sir, is all I
desire for her," replied she; "and that I trust she may
be, in whatever position she is placed."
</p>

<p>
'"With such a mother, she cannot be otherwise than
good," replied Sir Harry, with a little bow.  "And as
for happiness, she will have all that people covet most,
to give it her,&mdash;rank, wealth, beauty."
</p>

<p>
'And here, I suppose, Sir Harry caught sight of me
gazing at him with eyes rounded by astonishment;
for he broke off what he was saying, to ask me if I had
forgiven him yet for spoiling my ride, and whether I
would do him the great favour of showing him the
fox's brush I had told him about, etc. etc.  He certainly
was very good-natured, and treated me more like a
woman than any one had ever done before.  He asked
me to take wine with him, and bowed with so much
deference, that I felt quite shy and uncomfortable for
a moment.  He asked about all my plays and studies,
seemed quite interested in hearing of the delights of
going fishing with Oliver and Roger, in stories about
the young hawks which Miles and I were bringing up
between us, and in the brood of rabbits which belonged
to us all.  Then he wanted to know if I was fond of
music; if I could sing or play or dance; and, for the
first time in my life, I felt rather ashamed of being
obliged to say no to all these questions.
</p>

<p>
'"But you would like to learn, would you not?"
said Sir Harry when we arrived at this point in the
conversation, putting another bunch of grapes on my
plate as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes; I think I should, if mamma would let me;"
and I looked doubtfully in her direction.  But it was
my father who replied.
</p>

<p>
'"Liking has nothing to do with it.  Frances will
of course learn whatever is necessary for her future
rank and station.  There is plenty of time: the child
is only ten years old, I believe."
</p>

<p>
'"Eleven in May," I could not help whispering
though dreadfully frightened at my own boldness;
and I suppose mamma thought I had gone quite far
enough, for she rose to leave the room, signing to me
to follow her; which I did willingly enough, eager to
escape the displeasure which I felt sure I read in my
father's eyes, and hoping that now at last I should
hear the meaning of all the mysteries which had
puzzled me that morning.  Mamma looked very grave,
as she took my hand and led me into that little room
which your uncle now calls his "laboratory," I believe,
and which smells of sulphur and gunpowder, and all
kinds of dreadful things.  It never smelt of anything
worse than dried lavender and rose leaves in my time;
for it was mamma's own sitting-room, where she heard
me my lessons, gave orders to the servants, and did
all kinds of things, which the present Lady Dalrymple
would leave to her housekeeper.  I began to think
that the something, which I felt sure was going to be
revealed to me, was some dreadful misfortune, when
she kissed me, and said:
</p>

<p>
'"My little Frances is longing to know what we
were all saying at dinner-time about her, is she not?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes&mdash;oh yes, madam.  What is it?  What did
Sir Harry Mountfort mean by saying that I should
have a splendid position at court some day?  And
what did&mdash;&mdash;?"  Here I stopped abruptly, for there
were certainly tears in mamma's eyes, though she tried
to smile, as she told me to bring my stool to her side,
and she would tell me all about it.
</p>

<p>
'"You heard us talking about the Earl of Desmond,
Frances," she said, smoothing my hair softly back from
my forehead as I leant against her.  "He is a boy of
about fourteen, an orphan, and Sir Harry Mountfort is
his guardian.  Sir Harry is a great friend of your
father's; and for various reasons which you would not
understand, even if I told them to you, he has proposed
that a marriage shall take place between you and his
ward.  Your father has consented; and he brought
Sir Harry down here to-day to inform me of their
plans, and to make various arrangements which are
necessary, before the wedding can take place."
</p>

<p>
'"Wedding!  Then I am to be married now?&mdash;soon?&mdash;not
wait till I am grown up?" I asked eagerly.
</p>

<p>
'"I believe so; before very long, at any rate," said
my mother.  And I sat silent, trying to take it all in,
for at least two whole minutes.  Confused and surprised
as I felt, I was not quite so much taken aback as Silvia
would be if her uncle informed her that a like event
was to happen to her; for I had often heard mamma
talk about the little Princess Mary, the sister of the
reigning king, Charles II., who had been married when
she was only eleven years old.
</p>

<p>
'Moreover, my own mother's wedding had taken
place when she was but fifteen, while a little cousin of
hers had been a bride at nine.
</p>

<p>
'"Married to the Earl of Desmond!" I repeated
slowly.  "Then, shall I have to manage a house, and
have keys, and settle the dinners, and order the
servants, like you, mamma?"
</p>

<p>
'"Not for a great many years to come, I hope,
Frances.  I don't think you are quite fit for that at
present, are you?"
</p>

<p>
'"I could order dinner, I think," said I; a momentary
vision coming across me of myself in a sweeping
gown just like mamma's, with mittens on my arms, a
large apron with pockets in it, a chatelaine hanging by
my side, and jingling an immense bunch of keys while
I discoursed to the maids about bleaching the linen
on the bowling-green, or to the men about the brewing;
or perhaps gave away medicine, food, and advice
to the poor people on Lord Desmond's estates.  I
gave it up with a little sigh, for I had a great desire
to be considered a woman; and then, a fresh view of
the case suddenly occurring to me, I cried: "Oh
mamma, what shall I be called when I am married?
Shall I be Lady Desmond, just as you are Lady
Dalrymple?"
</p>

<p>
'"You will be Frances Carey Countess of Desmond,
of higher rank than I am, my child.  I am only the
wife of a baronet: you will be the wife of an earl."
</p>

<p>
'This piece of grandeur filled my foolish little head
with such a sense of elation, that I was on the point
of running away directly to tell the news to nurse and
my brothers; but a glance at mamma's face stopped
me.  "Don't you like my being Countess of Desmond,
mamma?" I ventured to ask, a sort of vague fear
coming into my heart for the first time.  "They won't
take me away from you, will they?"  I took hold of
her hand and held it very tight.
</p>

<p>
'"No, no," cried my mother in a voice which
sounded as if she was angry with me; and yet she
held me very close all the time.  "You will be my
Frances, my only daughter, just the same.  A wife's
duties are the same, in whatever station she is placed:
and who can teach you to love, honour, and obey your
husband, as well as I can?  But what am I talking
of!" she added in a different tone, seeing that I was
looking at her, very much puzzled.
</p>

<p>
'Mamma, who was usually so quiet and composed,
had a bright colour in her cheeks, and was talking
faster and louder than I had ever heard her in my life
before.  She smiled when she saw how surprised I
looked, and said, more in her natural voice:
</p>

<p>
'"You are too young, Frances, to understand quite
what I was thinking about.  I could have wished
that your marriage could have been put off till you
were old enough to know your own mind; but your
father says it must take place at once.  Of course he
knows best; so that may be considered as settled.
All I want you to remember is, that the promise you
make on your wedding day you will some day be
called upon to fulfil.  And now run away and tell the
others all about it."
</p>

<p>
'I said "yes;" but I do not think I quite took in all
mamma meant, so eager was I to obey the last part
of her commands and tell my wonderful news to the
boys.  I could not find any one in the nursery but
nurse and Rebecca, who were quite as much surprised
and struck with my tidings as I could have wished.
Nurse said, "Mercy on us!  Dear heart alive!" three
times over, and then begged I would not forget my
poor old nursey when I was a grand madam; while
Rebecca took to calling me "my lady" from that day
forward, till mamma discovered it and stopped her.
But where were the boys?  I cared much more for
what Oliver thought of the matter than for the opinion
of any one else in the world.  And, besides&mdash;though
I liked it&mdash;I found the servants' sudden respect rather
embarrassing.  Miles and Roger were out-of-doors,
nurse said, "in some pickle or another," she'd "warrant
them."  Her words were certainly prophetic; for,
after a long hunt, I discovered Miles on the top branch
of a very rotten old ash tree, which overhung the
deepest part of the pond in the park; endeavouring
with a long looped string to catch the sails of his
favourite toy boat, which had floated far away from
the shore; while Roger, on the very edge of the steep
bank, was making violent efforts to reach it with the
end of a slender pole.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing I could say would induce them to come
away, till I announced that I saw Shad and Oliver
riding into the stable-yard, and proposed that we
should race to meet them, and ask Shad to rescue the
unhappy boat.  Roger set off directly, and Miles got
out of the tree so quickly that I really thought he
must tumble into the pond in doing so.  He scrambled
down safe, however, with very green clothes and a
very red face; and after a rush across the park, and
a few words with Oliver, the two carried off the
good-natured Shad between them, and I was left alone with
my eldest brother.  He was in very high spirits, and
whenever I tried to begin my story, burst in with
some new description of the run.
</p>

<p>
'"What a pity you didn't come, Frances!" said he
at last.  "By the by, what did my father want with
you?"
</p>

<p>
'"That is just what I have been trying to tell you
ever since you came in," said I pettishly; "but you
would not listen; and I'm sure it's much more important
than about the fox getting into Farmer Grimley's
yard, or how you rode down all the pigs."
</p>

<p>
'"Why, what can it be?" said Oliver, looking
intensely surprised.  "You generally like to hear
about all those sort of things so much, Frances."
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, yes, I know; but oh!  Oliver, what do you
think of this?  I am going to be married to the Earl
of Desmond!"  Oliver opened his eyes so wide for a
moment that I thought he would never be able to shut
them again, and then, much to my astonishment and,
I am afraid, disgust, went off into a hearty fit of
laughter.
</p>

<p>
'"You going to be married!  Oh Frances, I can't
believe it!  What can the Earl of Desmond want to
marry you for?"  I do not think Oliver meant to be
rude, but brothers are not over particular; and I felt
deeply offended.  I, who had been treated with so
much attention by my father's friend, who had been
taken into mamma's confidence, and who was about
soon to become, as I phrased it to myself, "a married
woman," was I to be laughed at by a little boy a whole
year younger than myself?
</p>

<p>
'"And pray, why should he not want to marry me?"
said I, drawing myself up to my full height.  "But,
of course, one cannot expect a child of your age to
understand anything about it; so I was wrong to
expect it."  And I walked away, with what I then
thought an exact imitation of mamma's most dignified
manner, imagining that Oliver must be completely
crushed by this cutting reply.  But he only laughed
(it is impossible to put Oliver out of temper) and
said:
</p>

<p>
'"Come, Fan, you needn't be quite so scornful.  Of
course I want to hear all about it.  Who is the Earl
Desmond?  Not that gentleman who came here to-day,
surely?"
</p>

<p>
'"No," said I, slightly softened, but still, I am
afraid, rather patronizing; "he is a boy a year or two
older than I am, Oliver&mdash;about fourteen, I believe."
</p>

<p>
'"You don't mean it?" cried he, very much excited.
"I fancied he was grown-up.  Is he coming here? will
he live here?  Oh Frances!  I always did wish you
were a boy; but of course, if you marry this Earl of
Desmond, he will be my brother.  I always did want
another brother, Miles and Roger are so little.  By
the by, what is his name?"
</p>

<p>
'I did not know; and Oliver went on with a string
of questions, all relating to my future husband, not one
of which was I able to answer; for, to say the truth,
though my head had been full of my marriage ever
since I had heard of it, the bridegroom himself had
hardly entered into my thoughts at all.
</p>

<p>
'"Why, Fan, how stupid of you!" cried Oliver at
last, after listening to about a dozen "don't knows"
in succession.  "You don't seem to know anything.
I can't think why you did not ask mamma more
questions while you were about it.  Girls are generally
curious enough at any rate about other people's
business.  You might at least have found out whether he
is to come here, or whether you are to go and live in
his house.  I declare I shall ask mamma myself
to-night."
</p>

<p>
'"No, Oliver; indeed you had much better not.
Do you know I think mamma is very unhappy about it?"
</p>

<p>
'"Unhappy!  Then, of course, that must be because
you are going away."
</p>

<p>
'"No, I don't know; but I have an idea that I am
not going away, because, from what mamma said just
now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Well, what did she say?  Come, dear old Fan,
you always tell me everything."  And Oliver put his
arm round my neck and pulled me down on a stone
trough by the edge of the horse-pond&mdash;not the kind
of seat, I think, that nurse would have chosen for the
future Countess of Desmond, especially when that
young lady had on her quilted scarlet kirtle and new
silver-grey gown, worked with wheat and poppies.
When Oliver rubbed his curly, yellow head against
my cheek and called me "dear old Fan," I never
could resist him, even when I was really out of humour;
so, giving up the grand airs that I had been trying to
assume, I sat by his side on the horse-trough and told
him all that mamma had been saying about teaching
me to love, honour, and obey my husband, and about
my being called upon some day to fulfil the promises
which I should make at my marriage.
</p>

<p>
'"It's the having to obey him that will be the worst
part," was Oliver's first remark after we had both
pondered silently for a moment.  "That's just what
you will particularly hate, Fan.  I'm sure you'll never
keep that part of the promise.  Why, you never were
over-fond of obeying any one except mamma."
</p>

<p>
'This was a slight drawback, certainly, when one
came to think about it.  Oliver was right in his opinion
that I dearly loved my own way,&mdash;and, with my
brothers and Shad, I generally contrived to get it:
for to the boys I made the most of my privileges as
the eldest and the only girl; and as to Shad, he was
the one person in the house who was willing to let us
all have our own way.  But then there were so many
people to keep us in order.  When there was mamma,
my father, Master Waynefleet, not to mention old
nurse, one certainly did not want any one else to
command one's obedience.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, of course, one's husband would be different,"
I said a little bit doubtfully, nevertheless.  "You
know mamma always obeys my father, though I don't
think she quite likes it; at least not always.  Do you
know she said to-day that she wished I could have
waited till I was older, to be married, but that papa
thought it best that it should be at once.  So it must
be settled."  I did not add, as mamma had done,
"till I was old enough to know my own mind."  At
ten years old, I thought people, of course, must know
their own minds; and I felt quite sure that I wanted
to be the Earl of Desmond's wife, and that it would
be a terrible disappointment to me if anything were
to happen to prevent the marriage, or even to put it
off till I should be grown-up.
</p>

<p>
'"Well," said Oliver philosophically, "perhaps
people's husbands are different; at all events, that's
your business.  As long as I'm not forced to obey
him, I don't care who does.  But, Fan, won't it be
good fun when he comes here.  Is he very rich?  I
daresay he'll bring his own horses, and perhaps hounds
too, and we can all go out hunting together.  I wonder
if he cares for fishing?"
</p>

<p>
'"I think he is very rich and grand," I remarked;
"because Sir Harry said something about my having
a splendid position at court."
</p>

<p>
'Oliver's countenance fell rather at this idea.  He
evidently could not appreciate the delights of "a
splendid position at court."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah, but that would not be for a long while, surely,
Fan; very likely not till you are grown-up.  Fancy
you mincing about in a court dress, just like a peacock,
and saying, 'May it please your Majesty,' and
flourishing an enormous fan!"
</p>

<p>
'I was ashamed to confess it to Oliver, but in my
secret soul I rather liked this picture of myself in the
"splendid position."
</p>

<p>
'"Yes," continued Oliver, "we shall have good
sport if this husband of yours is a pleasant kind
of a fellow; but we should have better still, if he
was going to take you away with him to live at his
own house."
</p>

<p>
'This speech did not sound like a brotherly one;
and it wounded my feelings severely.
</p>

<p>
'"Really, Oliver," cried I, with flaming cheeks and
eyes brimming with tears, "you are very unkind and
selfish.  I thought you would be glad that I am not
going ever so far away, where you would never see me
at all."
</p>

<p>
'"Why, Fan! don't be silly.  You always get into
such a fume about nothing.  I only meant that I
might come and stay with you, and we could do
everything we chose, and you could order dinner, and
sit at the head of the table, and carve, of course; or
I could carve for you, and we should have no lessons
or cross-grained Master Waynefleets to plague us."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah, but you would only be able to come now
and then," said I more gently, for my anger was a
good deal softened down.  Oliver's plans for my
married life were certainly charming, and threw even
the "splendid position" into the shade.
</p>

<p>
'"There's a good girl!  That's the best of you, Fan.
If you do put yourself in a fume for nothing, you are
out again almost as soon as you are in.  Now, you
didn't really believe I wanted you to go away?  Why
you must know how dull it would be here, without
you to quarrel with and lord it over the small boys!"
</p>

<p>
'The idea of such a state of things so melted Oliver,
that, as we were quite alone&mdash;not even the said small
boys in sight&mdash;he actually condescended to kiss me,
or rather to let me kiss him,&mdash;a most unwonted sign
of affection on his part; for he generally sturdily
refused to be kissed by anybody but mamma (and
even to that he submitted with great reluctance),
except once a year, on his birthday.  So, my good
temper being quite restored by this, we sat very
happily on our trough, chattering too fast to observe
that Oliver's muddy boot was not improving the
splendour of the scarlet kirtle, and that the poppy-covered
skirt, to the length of at least two inches, was
steeping itself in the green water of the horse-pond.
Presently the sound of footsteps and voices made us
look round; and when the yard-gate opened, and Sir
Harry Mountfort and my father suddenly appeared
upon the scene, we were so much startled, that Oliver's
first exploit was to topple backwards into the trough,
while I, with like promptitude, sprang up, plunging
one foot ankle-deep into the pond.  This was an
embarrassing state of things.  For the first time I became
conscious of the deplorable state of my frock; and
when I saw Sir Harry's stare of surprise, not unmixed
with amusement, and my father's face of annoyance,
I felt inclined to take another and more effectual
plunge into the horse-pond, and vanish for ever in its
stagnant depths.  It really makes me laugh now to
remember what a very absurd figure I must have
looked, with my fine embroidered dress soaked in
muddy water, and my hair blowing about in a mad
state of dishevelment, from beneath one of Oliver's
most ancient and battered hats, which I had snatched
off a peg in the hall as I ran out to look for the boys
after dinner.  I had never been in the habit of caring
much how I looked.  Brothers of ten years old are not
critical with regard to their sisters' appearance.  On
the contrary, they make a point of discouraging the
least attempt to look "nice" (as you would call it);
and as to taking care of their own clothes, or those of
other people, why, I should have been withered up
with scorn if I had suggested such a notion to my
brothers!  But I never had.  It was only to-day that
Sir Harry's compliments, and the prospect of my new
dignities, had put it into my head to think about my
dress and appearance.  The fact that I was a remarkably
pretty little girl had never struck me before; and
now that I had begun to care for these things, and
particularly wished to look my best, here was the
bride-elect, the future Countess of Desmond,
ignominiously caught splashing about in a stable-yard,
drenched in mud and mire, and attired in that shabby,
old, high-crowned hat.  Oliver told me afterwards
that I looked like a witch who had just been ducked.
My father surveyed us from head to foot with a curling
lip and severe eyes; then he turned, with a short laugh
to Sir Harry, and said something in a low voice.  The
only words I could distinctly hear were: "Just as I told
you ... put an end to this;" to which Sir Harry
answered with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders, which
stung me to such a degree that I forgot all his flattering
speeches, and for a moment absolutely hated him.
</p>

<p>
'"Come here, Frances," my father said; and I
obeyed slowly and reluctantly.  "What would your
mother say, child, if she heard you had been romping
with your brother in the stable?"
</p>

<p>
'"She would not mind, sir; at least, perhaps, she
would to-day, because of my holiday gown.  But I
often come here with Oliver."
</p>

<p>
'"And we were not romping," interrupted Oliver;
"we were only talking; and it was my fault that she
has spoiled her kirtle, for I dragged her down on to the
trough.  Indeed, sir, mamma always lets Fan come here;
and she fishes for carp with me sometimes."  I was
grateful to Oliver for standing up for me; but I could
have wished that he had not mentioned the carp just
then.
</p>

<p>
'"Indeed!" was my father's reply.  "Well, you had
better go up to nurse and tell her to make you look
more like a gentlewoman, and less like a strolling-player.
A stable-yard is all very well for your brother,
but hardly the place where one expects to find a young
lady."  This was a sentiment in which both nurse and
Rebecca most thoroughly agreed; and they continued
to enlarge upon it all the time that they were setting
me to rights in the nursery.
</p>

<p>
'"A very fit place for Master Oliver, to be sure,
seeing that he was a boy and had all his old clothes
on, just come back from hunting.  But to think that
Mistress Frances should be found there! and by the
strange gentleman too&mdash;Mistress Frances, who was
going to be married so soon, and, what was more,
to marry a lord!  Alack! alack!"  Nurse could
only shake her head despondingly.  Her young lady
was certainly very far at present from her beau-ideal
of "a grand madam."  I felt very much humiliated,
and consequently very cross and sulky; and when at
last I was set free from nurse's hands, I stood in
pouting silence watching the sunset out of the nursery
window, and wishing that Sir Harry Mountfort and
the Earl of Desmond had never been heard of; envying
Oliver, who sat eating the dinner that had been kept
for him, and holding forth to Miles and Roger
on the adventures of Shad and himself during their
morning's sport.....
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>
'When I awoke on the morning of my wedding day,
with a vague consciousness that something unusual
was going to happen, the first thing that met my eyes
was a dazzling heap of white satin that completely
covered the table; and I had stared dreamily at it for
some minutes before the fact that I was looking at
my wedding dress dawned upon me.  Then suddenly
a clear recollection of what was going to take place
came with a rush into my mind.  I raised myself on
my elbow and gazed round the room, which seemed
quite spread over with silk and satin, ribbons and lace.
And there was nurse bustling about amidst all the
finery, herself in more gorgeous array than I had ever
seen her wear before.
</p>

<p>
'"Now, Mistress Frances, my dear," quoth she,
when she saw that I was awake, "'tis high time to get
up and be dressed.  Why, you've slept full an hour
later than usual; and I wouldn't wake you, because I
heard you tossing about last night, hours and hours
after you should have been asleep and dreaming."
</p>

<p>
'This was true; for I had been in such a feverish
state of excitement the night before, that though
mamma had sent me to bed earlier than usual, I had
heard the church clock strike one before I could go to
sleep.  And now, though the day to which I had been
looking forward for the last month had actually come
at last, though my wedding-dress was lying in all its
glory before my eyes, I felt far more inclined to sink
back on my pillow and fall asleep again, than to get
up and be dressed, as nurse proposed.
</p>

<p>
'"What, sweetheart!" she went on, as I blinked my
eyes drowsily; "sure, you haven't forgotten you are
going to be married to-day?  And there's the young
gentleman himself playing in the garden with your
brother, and never so much as set eyes on his
bride!"  These words of nurse's effectually roused me.
</p>

<p>
'"What!" cried I, wide awake at length; "did he
come then, nurse, after all?  And was it very late?
And what is he like?"  I took a flying leap out of
bed before I had finished my string of questions, and,
mounting on the window-sill, looked out upon the
garden and park.  You know the window I mean;
my bedroom was the same that Christie and Dolly
have now&mdash;only, in my time the uneven oak boards
were not hidden by a carpet, and there was one
immense four-post bed hung with green taffeta, instead
of two little curtainless French ones.  No pretty
toilet-table was in existence then, decked out with pink
calico and white muslin.  That little square table in
the library, carved with grapes and vine-leaves, and
men with goat's legs, used to stand in the middle of
my room in those days, and I used to look at
myself in a small oval mirror in an ebony frame that
hung on the wall, and the top of which I had
ornamented with my fox's brush.  Extremely bare
and uncomfortable such a room would doubtless seem
to you, but it never struck me in that light.  Compared
to the boy's room, it was extremely well furnished&mdash;almost
luxurious.  However, I must not dwell upon
my dear old room and its furniture.  I liked it because
it was my own, and I kept all my treasures there; but
of course I cannot expect you to take the same interest
in it&mdash;only, I thought perhaps you might like to know
how Christie's bedroom looked when I woke there on
my wedding morning nearly two centuries ago.  It
was a lovely morning, though very sharp and wintry.
The sky was a pale-blue one, without a single cloud;
and a little snow had fallen during the night, but only
enough to scatter a few flakes among the dark glossy
leaves and red berries of the holly trees, and to sprinkle
the country with a light powdery covering that
sparkled like diamond-dust in the sun.  I could see
the boys as I looked from my window: there they
were, as nurse had said, careering about the
garden&mdash;Roger's small wiry figure, Miles' square sturdy one,
and Oliver a head and shoulders above them both;
and there was also a fourth figure, towards which I
strained my eyes with intense interest.  But at such
a distance very little was to be seen; my curiosity
was obliged to be satisfied for the present with the
discovery that he was taller and stouter than Oliver,
but neither his face nor even the colour of his dress
was to be distinguished.  This bird's-eye view of my
bridegroom was unsatisfactory, being cut short by
nurse, who dragged me indignantly down from the
window-seat just as Lord Desmond was aiming at
Oliver's head with a snow-ball, and I was watching in
breathless excitement to see whether it would hit.
</p>

<p>
'"Lack-a-mercy!  Mistress Frances, do you want to
catch your death of cold on your wedding day, and
for all the company to be at church before you are
dressed?"

'Not wishing to bring down either of these calamities
on my head, I reluctantly allowed myself to be drawn
away from the window, and submitted passively to a
longer and more elaborate toilet than I had ever
undergone in my life before.  Meanwhile I consoled
myself by asking nurse all manner of questions about
the bridegroom,&mdash;what he was like, who were his
companions, and the time and manner of his arrival.  I
could not get a great deal of news out of her,&mdash;she was
too much wrapped up in the splendours of my bridal
gear.  Only now and then, between her bursts of
enthusiasm over each piece of finery in turn, and her
pathetic warnings to me to "have a care of such brave,
goodly raiment," did she find time to impart in snatches
the following information.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Harry Mountfort had arrived the previous night
with his ward the young Lord Desmond, and his little
niece Mistress Agnes Blount, who was to be one of
my bride-maidens.  The house of New Court, Sir
Harry's home, was about twenty miles from
Horsemandown, and the travellers were nearly half-way
upon their road when a report reached them of
highwaymen being in the neighbourhood.  This rumour,
though vague and doubtful, was nevertheless somewhat
alarming, as the country through which their journey
lay was extremely wild and lonely; especially one
part of the road through the Boarhurst woods&mdash;those
woods where you had your picnic last summer.
There were no broad, smooth carriage-drives through
them, though, in our time; only a narrow bridle-path,
through which Lord Desmond and his companions
must ride in single file.  So Sir Harry thought it
prudent to go back for a larger escort, and it was on
that account that they had not reached Horsemandown
till ten o'clock in the evening (just an hour after
mamma had, much to my indignation, ruthlessly sent
me to bed).  Thus much I contrived to draw out of
nurse, by dint of persistent cross-examination all the
time I was being dressed; also, that Lord Desmond
was a dark young gentleman, a fair-spoken lad enough,
and not ill-favoured, but nought to set beside Master
Oliver, with his bonnie blue eyes and yellow locks.
</p>

<p>
'"As to little Mistress Blount, she was so wearied,
poor lamb!" said nurse, "that she scarce kept her eyes
open to eat her supper; and when my lady told me
to put her to bed, she was not so loth to come as you
were yesternight, Mistress Frances."
</p>

<p>
'I was rather anxious to go down to breakfast in
full bridal array, from the rich lace veil to the long
white gloves embroidered with silver thread; but nurse
was greatly scandalized at such a suggestion.
</p>

<p>
'"A pretty notion, forsooth!" quoth she with a
derisive snort.  "What!  Mistress Fan, would you
have those beautiful lace ruffles dip into the trenchers,
and get steeped in honey and conserves?  Sure,
Master Oliver's basin of milk would be pouring over
your fine kirtle, before breakfast was over.  No, no; I
am going at least to send you to church fit to behold,
happen what may afterwards."
</p>

<p>
'And mamma coming in while we were disputing
settled the point instantly in favour of nurse's decree.
I could not argue with mamma, so I was silenced as
once; and quietly submitted to wear one of the pretty
new dresses, which had been made for my wedding
outfit.  Mamma sent nurse away, saying that she
would finish dressing me herself; and I was glad to
be alone with her, for I had seen much less of her than
usual of late.  Ever since Sir Harry had left us, rather
more than a fortnight before, there had been a constant
bustle of preparation going on in the house.  It was
not only my approaching wedding that caused this
bustle,&mdash;the Christmas festivities had also to be
prepared for; and mamma had been busy from morning
till night.  Besides the roast beef and boar's head, the
plum-pudding and mince-pies, for our own household,
there was Christmas cheer for the poor people of the
village to be supplied,&mdash;blankets and fuel and
clothing to be given away.  Then there were my wedding
clothes, too, for mamma to think about.  Such an
ample new wardrobe had been provided for me, that
I began to think that my husband and I were to take
up our "splendid position at court" at once, after all,
instead of waiting till the far-off time of being
grown-up.  I could not help feeling considerable pride and
satisfaction in these new clothes of mine; they were
made in such a much less childish way than my old
ones, and cut so much more in the fashion of the
day.  Once, when nurse was asleep after dinner, I
gave Oliver a private view of them; but he made
such horrible faces of ridicule and contempt, that
my own respect for them began to diminish on the
spot.
</p>

<p>
'It certainly was wearisome work having these
things continually tried on.  "Pride feels no pain,"
nurse and Rebecca used to assure me when they
pounced upon me just as I was rushing into the
garden with the boys to feed the rabbits, or into the
kitchen on the chance of getting a stray dainty from
the manifold good things in preparation there.
Nevertheless my pride generally gave way, on these
occasions, to the twofold pain of being obliged to
stand still, and of seeing the boys run off without me;
and I used to pout and fume and twitch till it became
hard to tell which was most out of humour&mdash;nurse,
Rebecca, or myself.
</p>

<p>
'"What is the use of my having all these grand
new things if I am not to have a house of my own, but
to go on living at home just the same as ever?"  This
question suddenly struck me one day, and I asked
nurse; whereupon she shut her eyes and shook her
head, remarking that "little ladies shouldn't be
curious;" after which she gave vent to a doleful and
ominous sigh, and kissed me, muttering something
about a "poor thoughtless dear."  Now, as mamma
was putting the finishing touches to my toilet,
arranging my tucker, and smoothing the hair that always
seemed to get into disorder if I moved my head, I put
the same question to her; but she only smiled a little
and stroked my head, telling me that I should know
everything in good time.  "But, madam," I
persisted, "is Lord Desmond going to stay here, and
live with us, and play with me, and do lessons like
Oliver?"
</p>

<p>
'"No, my dear Fan," she said, "he will not stay
with us, neither will you go away with him; but that
is all I can tell you at present.  To-morrow we shall
have time for a little talk together, and then you shall
hear all about your father's&mdash;about our plans for you.
Now, sweetheart, you shall say your prayers to me
this morning; and then we must go down to breakfast,
and present you to this little bridegroom of yours."  My
mother said these last words playfully, and her
own bright smile shone in her eyes for a moment; but
in the next they were swimming with tears, and
her voice sounded very odd and husky when, after I
had prayed as usual for her, my father, and my
brothers, she bade me pray also that my husband
might be blessed, and that when I grew up to be a
woman I might keep the promises which I was going
to make to-day.
</p>

<p>
'How well I remember the sudden rush of shyness
which came over me as I went down the staircase
that morning!  Never in my life before had I felt so
painfully and intensely shy.  Miles and Roger passed
us, extremely snowy and wet and rosy, running up to
their nursery breakfast, and at that instant I had a
strong inclination to burst away from mamma and fly
after them.
</p>

<p>
"I say," whispered Roger confidentially, catching
my sleeve as he passed, "your husband wants to know
if it makes you angry to be snow-balled."
</p>

<p>
'"Poor Fan," said Miles with heartfelt commiseration
as he glanced at my dress, "I suppose she will
never be able to make snow-balls now, or catch carp
any more!"
</p>

<p>
'Mamma drew her hand gently away from me when
we reached the door of the breakfast parlour, and I
followed her into the room with glowing cheeks, and
eyes fixed on the floor.  It was in what is now the
billiard-room that we used to breakfast, and it seemed
to me perfectly full of people.  Though Sir Harry
Mountfort had not been able to bring his ward till the
night before, there had been no lack of guests staying
in the house since Christmas-eve.  It was the first
time for two or three years that my father had been
at home at this season; and Horsemandown was
fuller of visitors, and more merriment had been going
on in the shape of mumming, dancing, and Christmas
games, than had ever been the case before in my
recollection.  When I rose up from the very deep
and swimming courtesy with which the young ladies
of my time were taught to greet their acquaintances,
I was for a few moments only conscious of eyes bent
upon me, and voices buzzing confusedly in my ears.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, here she is at last!"  "Here is the little
bride!"  "Poor child, how shamefaced she is!"  "Faith,
a well-favoured little maiden too!" were some of the
exclamations that greeted my entrance; while my
father came toward me at once, kissed my forehead
very affectionately, and led me, wavering between
shyness and curiosity, up to one of the deep window
recesses, in which Sir Harry Mountfort stood talking
to a group of gentlemen.  He broke off what he was
saying, and advanced to meet me, exclaiming:
</p>

<p>
'"But here comes the heroine of the day&mdash;the fair
bride herself!  And now for the introduction!  Faith,
Algernon, I should not mind changing places with
you a few years hence, if that face performs all that it
promises."  The last words were said in rather a lower
tone, as Sir Harry leant his hand on the shoulder of a
boy who was talking eagerly to Oliver, and who had
not turned, as most of the other company had done,
when mamma and I came into the room.  He was
obliged to do so now, however, and, with rather an
embarrassed smile, came forward at his guardian's
bidding, took my hand, and, murmuring a few words
of greeting, reluctantly kissed my cheek.  I had not
the least idea of what I ought to say to him, and
apparently he was in the same predicament with regard to
me.  Mamma was obliged to go and attend to her
other guests, so I was left helpless, gazing at my future
husband in dead silence for a full minute.  I suppose
he found this disagreeable, for he coloured intensely,
and at length with a great effort managed to say,
"Oliver has been showing me your ponies."
</p>

<p>
'I said, "Oh!" and then by a sudden inspiration
added, "Which did you think the prettiest?"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh!  Oliver's, without doubt."
</p>

<p>
'"<i>I</i> think Hebe the prettiest," I said with decision.
Silence fell on us once more, and I really thought this
time it would last for ever.  Never did I feel more
grateful to Sir Harry than when he brought up his
little niece to me, saying he hoped we should be great
friends and see a good deal of each other.
</p>

<p>
'Agnes Blount set us at our ease directly.  She
was not at all shy; she found it possible to smile and
answer prettily when my father politely hoped that
she had recovered from the fatigues of her arduous
journey.  She told us all about the adventures she
and her companions had met with the day before,
appealing to Lord Desmond to confirm her accounts
of the dreadful danger they were in from highwaymen,
the darkness of Boarhurst woods, and the horrible
state of the roads, until she set him talking as
unrestrainedly as any of us.  She won Oliver's heart by
saying she was fond of rabbits, and mine by the
interest she showed in hearing about the bridal
preparations.  The great banquet which had been
preparing for so many days I described minutely, as
indeed I was well qualified to do; for Miles and I had
cried over the slaughter which had taken place in my
mother's poultry-yard, and had only been comforted
by watching the troops of red-armed cooks and
scullions as they rushed hither and thither in endless
bustle; while huge pasties, delicate cakes, mince-pies,
and good things of all sorts, multiplied under their
hands as if by magic.  I whispered that the wassail
bowl was to be thrice as large as usual, in my honour;
and, finally, I imparted the important intelligence,
that at the dance which was to conclude the day's
festivities I was to appear in my bridal attire and
open the ball.  I don't think I had a very clear idea
of how I was to manage this operation; but on that
point Agnes managed to enlighten me, without showing
any unfeeling superiority over my ignorance.  She
could do everything, I gradually discovered; at least
a great many things that I could not, and which,
therefore, I looked upon with respectful admiration.
Sir Harry made her sing to us, in the afternoon, a
dainty little song, with a harp accompaniment, which
charmed everybody; and the graceful way in which
she glided through the mazes of a minuet with one of
our guests so delighted my father, that he paid her a
formal and elaborate compliment on the elegance of
her dancing.  I remember being very much surprised
at the time, to see him take so much notice of a little
girl; but I found out afterwards why he took such
an interest in Agnes Blount's accomplishments.  Well,
but I am getting on too fast.  Of course you want to
know all about my wedding, from the smoothing of
the last crease in my voluminous satin train (the care
of which was a source of dreadful anxiety to Agnes
and her fellow bridesmaids) to the moment when
Lord Desmond put upon my finger the tiniest gold
wedding-ring in the world.  It is a most bewildering
scene to look back upon, even after all these years;
and at the time I was so confused by what I had to
do, so encumbered by the grandeur of my apparel,
that I had but vague and indistinct ideas of what was
going on around me.  I remember the lines of eager
faces which startled me when I stepped out of the
coach at the churchyard gate.  I recollect experiencing
a sort of shock on seeing that the familiar path up to
the church porch was covered with crimson cloth; but
I think what struck me most of all with a sense of the
solemnity of the occasion, was that Master Waynefleet
whose thin locks I had contemplated for many a
Sunday, combed back and tied with a piece of ribbon,
was on this day resplendent in a curled and flowing
wig, and wore a surplice literally crackling with starch.
I believe I clung to my father's hand in a most
undignified manner as he led me up the aisle.  I have
a vision of a rainbow-coloured crowd of people on
either side of the altar; of mamma, a shade paler than
usual, but trying to smile, in order to reassure me;
of Oliver, in difficulties with his sword (which was only
worn on state occasions, and was a source of mingled
pride and embarrassment to its owner); of Roger, in
the background, struggling desperately with nurse,
in order to attain a lofty post of observation on the
tomb of a crusading Dalrymple.  But beyond this I
saw nothing, and can only repeat what nurse told me
afterwards, that "it was a gallant show, and did her
old eyes good to look at it.  I'd have gone ten miles
barefoot any day to see you in all your bravery,
Mistress Francis, dear, and that sweet young
gentleman, my Lord Desmond, a-holding your hand so
prettily, and your mamma, and all the grand ladies
shedding tears for joy, as indeed it was most befitting
they should."
</p>

<p>
'Nurse's praises and congratulations were the
forerunners of a great many more to which I had to listen
that day.  At first I liked them, and thought it grand
to be complimented on the "way in which I had borne
myself on such a trying occasion;" but at last I grew
very tired of hearing the same thing over and over
again.  The stiff, set speeches which people vied with
each other in making, the perpetual allusions to my
"tender years," and the hopes "that the union which
had commenced under such propitious circumstances
might hereafter be a source of great happiness to me,
and of satisfaction to my parents," were very tiresome;
and to all this I had to reply, as mamma had
carefully impressed on me beforehand, "Madam, you do
me much honour," or, "I thank you, sir, for your
good wishes," while I made a profound courtsey to
the lady or gentleman who addressed me.  Things
were not much better at the long, formal, wearisome
entertainment which ensued, and which I thought
never would be over.  People made speeches and
proposed toasts with every glass of wine they drank, and
some of them drank a great many&mdash;so many that at
last it was not quite easy to make out whose health
they did propose; and when this point was settled,
others seemed affronted at the toasts they had
chosen.
</p>

<p>
'I thought it all very uninteresting, after the health
of Lord and Lady Desmond had been drunk, and did
not listen to what was going on.  I only know that
the noise got louder and louder; so that, by the time
it was considered fitting that the ladies should retire to
the withdrawing-room, the clamour was so great that it
was almost impossible to distinguish what any one
said.  The last thing I saw, as we left the room, was Sir
Harry Mountfort standing up, flushed and excited,
holding a bumper of wine in one hand, while he brought
down the other clenched fist with violence on the
table, and called upon all present to fill their glasses
and drink to the health of the Duke of York, the
true heir to the throne.
</p>

<p>
'"What were they quarrelling about?" I asked
Agnes Blount when the uproar had died away in the
distance, and we had found a quiet corner to ourselves
at the end of the long drawing-room.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, politics, of course," she replied.  "We always
know at home, whenever the gentlemen get very
much excited over their wine, and all speak at once,
and don't seem to listen at all to what other people
are saying, that they are talking about politics."
</p>

<p>
'"Well, but what are politics?" said I.  "We don't
ever hear anything about them here."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, don't you know?  They are all about the
King, and the Parliament, Rochester, Halifax, and
Godolphin, and a great many names I can't remember,
for I never listen.  But I should have thought you must
have heard of them, for I know Sir Bernard Dalrymple
always has more to say about all those people than
anyone else who comes to my uncle's house."
</p>

<p>
"Then I suppose you have often seen my father
before you came here?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh yes; he has been there a great many times
lately&mdash;I suppose to settle about your marriage.
Algernon and I used to wonder what they could be
talking about when we saw them pacing up and down
the terrace by the hour together; till at last one day,
just as we were going to the fish-ponds with some
bread and honey to feed the carp, my uncle called
Algernon to him and said, 'Come and shake hands with
this gentleman, Algernon; he is going to give you
his daughter to be your little wife.'"
</p>

<p>
'"Well, and what did Algernon say?" I asked
eagerly; for, when Agnes arrived at this interesting
point in the story, she hesitated.
</p>

<p>
'"I don't think he quite liked the idea at first.
You see, he had not seen you then; and it seemed so
strange and sudden an idea," said Agnes rather
reluctantly.
</p>

<p>
'"But tell me exactly what he said," I persisted,
with a not unnatural desire to know how my
bridegroom had received the news which had excited me
so much.
</p>

<p>
'"Why, he said, 'When I am grown-up, I suppose,
sir?'  'Oh no,' replied Sir Harry; 'we will not put
your constancy to so severe a trial.  In six weeks'
time your marriage is to take place.'  Then Algernon
grew very red, and looked at his piece of bread and
honey so hard, that I thought he was making up his
mind where he would take the first bite; but at last
he looked up and said, 'If I must be married, sir, I
would rather marry Agnes, because she knows where
to find my fishing-tackle, and can always undo my
line when it gets into a tangle.'  My uncle burst into
a great fit of laughter when he heard this, and Sir
Bernard laughed a little too; but I grew very hot and
uncomfortable, and thought I should like to run away.
So I pulled Algernon's sleeve; but just then my uncle
left off laughing and said, 'No, no, Algernon, I have
no doubt that Agnes is much obliged for your good
opinion of her; but, as her guardian as well as yours,
I am afraid I must decline your kind proposal.  And
when you have seen your future bride, who is about the
prettiest little damsel I know, you will, I trust,
apologize to her father for having made such a proposition
in his very presence.'  Sir Bernard said no apology
was needed.  He shook hands with Algernon, and
called him a fine fellow, and, turning to me, said he
hoped to have the pleasure of seeing me at Horsemandown,
and trusted I would be kind enough to impart
to his daughter that knowledge of fishing operations
which Lord Desmond thought so necessary in a wife.
He looked very grave all the time, but I felt sure he
must be laughing at me, and I had much ado to
make my reverence and thank him without beginning
to cry.  That is how it was settled; and when
Algernon found out that you had brothers, and that
he was to have a week's holiday in honour of his
wedding, he began to like the idea very much.  For you
know, when I am at school he has no companions at all
at New Court, and his tutor and Lady Mountfort are so
very strict and severe that he has but a dreary life of it."
</p>

<p>
'My feelings had varied to and fro during Agnes's
recital.  Sir Harry's complimentary remarks hardly
made up for Algernon's indifference; but when she
ended, I forgot his offences in pity for one whose only
companions were a tutor and Lady Mountfort, whose
stiff figure and severe expression of countenance had
filled me with awe and dislike the moment I saw her.
"How dreadful!" I exclaimed.  "What should Oliver
and I do if we had to live like that?"
</p>

<p>
'"Hush!" said Agnes; "don't speak so loud, or
my aunt will hear you.  She says children ought
never to speak when they are in the same room as
their elders, unless they are spoken to."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh! but to-day surely she would not mind.
Mamma does not allow us, in general, to speak when
any one is here; but on my wedding day"&mdash;and I
drew up my head a little higher than usual&mdash;"things
are different."
</p>

<p>
'"I don't know," replied Agnes, looking uneasily
in the direction of Lady Mountfort; "she is so very
particular.  Perhaps I ought not to have told you all
this, Frances."
</p>

<p>
'"I am very glad you have.  Oliver and I have so
often wanted to know something about Algernon, but
mamma could not tell us much; and we never think
of asking my father any questions."
</p>

<p>
'"What has Agnes been telling you?" asked Lord
Desmond, who at that moment joined us with Oliver.
</p>

<p>
'"About New Court," interposed Agnes hastily,
apparently afraid I should relate the whole of our
conversation.  "I was telling Frances how very, very
strict my aunt is, and how quiet we are obliged to be
in her presence.  I am sure school is almost better,
if it were not for the lessons."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah!" said Algernon with a heartfelt sigh, "I
shall think it duller than ever, now I have been here.
Only imagine, Agnes: they go out with the hounds
once or twice a week here, with a groom who lets
them do whatever they like!  Why, when I go out
riding at home, or whatever I do, there is always
Master Hewling, with his starched countenance and
croaking voice, saying, 'It is not fitting, my lord, that
you should do this,' or, 'My duty to Sir Harry will
not permit me to allow your lordship to do the other!'  I
have never been allowed to do what I liked since
I came to Sir Harry's house&mdash;never!"
</p>

<p>
'"But I thought," said I with some dismay,
remembering the brilliant castles in the air which Oliver
and I had indulged in,&mdash;"I thought you had a fine
house of your very own, with beautiful gardens, and
park, and fishponds, and great stables as big as our
whole house.  That is what nurse told me!"
</p>

<p>
'"Ah!" said Algernon, looking so sad that I was
quite sorry I had said anything about it, "that was
where we lived when my father was alive.  But it is
of no use, for Sir Harry says I have not money enough
to live there; and besides, it is sold&mdash;no, not
sold&mdash;what is the word?&mdash;to somebody else."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, but I heard something!" said Agnes, and
then she stopped short and coloured, while we all
looked very much interested.
</p>

<p>
'"Well, what did you hear?" asked Algernon
eagerly.  "I will know, Agnes."
</p>

<p>
'"I don't think I ought to tell," she said, faltering
and looking very irresolute.
</p>

<p>
'"Did you promise you would not?" demanded
Algernon.  "No?  Then tell me directly."
</p>

<p>
'And Agnes, who, as I found out afterwards, always
did what everybody asked her, said: "It was only
that I chanced to be in the room when my aunt was
talking to Father Freeling about you, and she said,
'My husband has arranged a match for Algernon,
which will put all these unfortunate money matters
straight again.  The young lady will have an ample
fortune when she comes of age; and, what is better
still, her father has undertaken to pay down, on her
wedding day, a sum sufficient to clear off all those
mortgages (wasn't that the word you meant, Algernon?)
which Sir Harry's imprudent management rendered
necessary.'  'Indeed!' Father Freeling said, 'I think
Sir Harry has managed excellently well for the
interests of his ward; and I suppose, on the lady's side,
the title is considered'&mdash;I couldn't quite hear what;
for just then my sampler frame dropped down, which
I think reminded my aunt that I was in the room, for
she spoke in a much lower tone after that, and I could
only hear something about 'political considerations,'
and the vote of Sir Harry being required for some
'parliamentary bill,' and so on.  I could not quite
understand what they meant, but I could see they
thought you would be much richer for marrying
Frances; so perhaps you will be able to go and live
at your old home again.  You would like that, Algernon?"
</p>

<p>
'"And we will all come and stay with you," cried
Oliver, rather louder than prudence warranted; for
we had been talking hitherto almost in whispers, in
order to avoid the attention of our elders.  I looked
at Algernon to see what he thought of this proposal.
He looked rather grave and puzzled; I think he
understood a little better than we did the meaning of
all those long words which Agnes had repeated so
accurately, and which conveyed no idea to my mind at
all, except that Agnes thought I was very rich; which
struck me as being decidedly curious&mdash;my ideas of
riches in those days being limited to the amount of
money I had in an old china cup up-stairs in the
nursery.  I was just going to say that I had only at
present one silver piece there, when the stiff rustle of
Lady Mountfort's gown was heard approaching, and
we all sank into silence.  I should most probably have
forgotten all about this conversation, so little did I
understand the meaning of Agnes's words, had not
Algernon much later in the evening said to me in a
low voice:
</p>

<p>
'"Perhaps, Frances, you had better not talk about
what Agnes told us to any one.  She was not intended
to hear it; and&mdash;and&mdash;somehow I fancy that your
father and my guardian would not be over-pleased if
we said anything about it."
</p>

<p>
'"Very well, I will not," I replied, wondering very
much what part of Agnes's communication it could
be which was likely to make the good-humoured Sir
Harry angry.
</p>

<p>
'"You can keep a secret, I suppose?" said Algernon,
surveying me, as I thought, rather contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
'"Of course," said I in an offended tone; "I keep
all Oliver's.  But" (my curiosity here becoming too
much for my dignity) "I wish you would tell me
why."
</p>

<p>
'"I can't," replied Algernon, "for I don't quite
know myself; but I shall find out some day all about
what they were saying.  I wish I had heard it before;
it has something to do with the reason you and I were
married,&mdash;that is quite clear."
</p>

<p>
'"When you are grown-up, you will understand, I
suppose," said I.
</p>

<p>
'"O yes; long before that."
</p>

<p>
'"But it won't make any difference," said I decidedly.
"We can't be unmarried again, however we may wish
it, I know; for mamma told me so."
</p>

<p>
'"Well, I didn't say I wished to be unmarried, did
I?" demanded my bridegroom not very graciously,
and colouring very much as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh no," I said, feeling guiltily conscious of what
Agnes had told me.  "And I daresay we shall like
it very much when we are grown-up."
</p>

<p>
'"Of course," replied Algernon.  "And in the meantime
it does not much matter, because I don't suppose
we shall see each other very often."
</p>

<p>
'"Oliver thought you would come here and stay
with us sometimes," I remarked.  "He is always wishing
for a boy of his own age for a companion, because
Miles and Roger are so little."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah!  I should like that," said Algernon, who
evidently regarded a brother-in-law as a much more
interesting and valuable acquisition than a wife.  "But
Sir Harry told me a little while ago that he was going
to present me at court as soon as Parliament met, and
that it had already been settled that I should be
appointed one of the Duchess of York's pages."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh," said I, rather struck by this piece of intelligence.
"Shall you like that? what will you have to do?"
</p>

<p>
'"I don't know exactly; but there are a great many
pages&mdash;boys of my own age; so it is sure to be better
than New Court at any rate, where there is no one at
all to talk to when Agnes is away.  And she is only
a girl, after all."
</p>

<p>
'This remark was so exactly what Oliver would
have made under similar circumstances, that I did not
feel offended, and only asked whether Agnes always
came to New Court in her holidays.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes; she has nowhere else to go.  Her father
and mother are dead, and Sir Harry is her guardian;
and he promised her father that she should never be
made a Roman Catholic; so that is why he sends
her to school at Madame St. Aubert's.  You know"&mdash;and
Algernon lowered his voice to a mysterious whisper&mdash;"Lady
Mountfort is a Papist, and she is always trying
to convert people."
</p>

<p>
'"And is Sir Harry one too?" inquired I in a tone
of horror; for to be a Papist in those days meant to
belong to a religion proscribed by Act of Parliament,
and hated by all good Church of England people.
</p>

<p>
'"I don't know exactly," said Algernon, "but he
always does whatever she likes."
</p>

<p>
'Poor Sir Harry!  I pitied him from my heart; and
wondered more than ever how it happened that he
should be the husband of such a sour-faced,
disagreeable dame as Lady Mountfort.
</p>

<p>
'"I daresay she would like to make a Papist of
me," he continued; "but she never shall; for my
father was a Protestant, and I mean to be just like
him."
</p>

<p>
'I thought this resolution sounded heroic, especially
as I believed Lady Mountfort quite capable of inflicting
a dungeon, bread and water, and perhaps even the
rack, upon any unfortunate person whom she wished
to convert; and I respected Algernon accordingly.
He and I became very good friends before the evening
was over, though I must say I infinitely preferred my
first friend, Sir Harry, who danced with me several
times&mdash;helped me out when I made mistakes, or
appeared not to observe them&mdash;called me "Madame
la Countesse"&mdash;and made himself so amusing, that I
found myself many times regretfully wishing that I
could have been married to him instead of to Algernon.
</p>

<p>
'Ah! well.  People are not always quite so charming
as one fancies they are; and I never liked Sir
Harry so well after I discovered that it was he who
brought about what I then considered as the greatest
misfortune that could happen to me.  He persuaded
my father that I ought to be sent to school.
</p>

<p>
'Dear me! what floods of tears I shed when this
dreadful fact was first announced to me.  It was after
all our guests had gone&mdash;when the gaieties of that
exciting Christmas-time were over and done with&mdash;when
I was, to all intents and purposes, only little
Frances Dalrymple again, with all my short-lived
splendour put away out of sight, like that wedding
gown which nurse had packed so carefully in the great
walnut chest, with dried lavender sprinkled between
its shining folds.
</p>

<p>
'To be sent to school!&mdash;till the way to Taunton!  I
thought I might almost as well be sent to prison at
once; and said so, in the midst of my tears, to
mamma.
</p>

<p>
'"I shall never be allowed to run about, or play in
the garden, or ride!  Oh mamma, what will Hebe do
without me?"
</p>

<p>
'Mamma almost smiled when I reached this climax,
though she had looked grave enough just before; and
seeing the smile, I went on in a more melancholy
voice than ever:
</p>

<p>
'"Oh mamma, I didn't think <i>you</i> wanted me to go
away."
</p>

<p>
'"Frances, Frances, you don't know what you are
talking of," said my mother, taking me on her lap
(great girl as I was), and holding me very tight in her
arms.  "Do you really suppose I shall not miss you
a great deal more than Hebe will?"
</p>

<p>
'"Then why do you let me go?" I whispered, after
a good many more tears at the idea of mamma thinking
I cared more for Hebe than her.
</p>

<p>
'"Because your father thinks it best for you," was
the answer&mdash;the answer with which mamma used to
silence us even in our most rebellious moods.  No one
ever thought of disobeying his commands; and my
hopes sank lower and lower.
</p>

<p>
'"But, mamma," I said despairingly, looking down
at the little gold ring I was so proud of being allowed
to wear, "surely married ladies don't go to school.  I
thought they did whatever they liked."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed they don't always, even when they are
grown-up, Frances," she said with a little sigh.  "If I
did exactly what I liked, I should keep you at home
with me, instead of sending you to school; but you
see I have to trust to some one else to know what is
best for you, and so must you.  Why, it is just because
you are Lord Desmond's wife, that your father thinks
you ought to learn a great many things that I cannot
teach you properly.  If you were going to live down
here in the country all your life, perhaps it would not
matter so much; but when you are grown-up, you will
most likely have to go out a great deal more into the
world, and mix with a great many more people than
I ever did; and you would find it very inconvenient
to be ignorant of things which every one else knows
quite well.  For instance, you would like to be able
to sing and dance as well as Agnes Blount."
</p>

<p>
'"I am sure I never could," I said, feeling as if
Agnes's attainments were far beyond me, but beginning
to have some glimmering perception of what
mamma meant.
</p>

<p>
'"You must ask her to help you.  You are to go to
the school where she is now&mdash;Madame St. Aubert's.
So you see you have one friend there already; and I
have no doubt you will soon make many more.  So
cheer up, my foolish little Fan.  You look as
woebegone as if you were going to be sent to the
Tower."
</p>

<p>
'Mamma's words were more cheerful than her face
when she said this; and, as she put me down from
her knee with a kiss, I began to see that the parting
was as hard for her as it was for me; and I managed
to say, though not without a deep sigh:
</p>

<p>
'"I don't suppose they will be half such good playmates
as Oliver and the others; but I will try and
bear it; and I will learn everything as quickly as I
can, that I may come back sooner."
</p>

<p>
'"That's my good child," said mamma, patting my
head approvingly.  "And remember, there are always
the holidays to look forward to.  How you will enjoy
them!"
</p>

<p>
'But the holidays seemed too far off for me to have
much pleasure as yet in looking forward to them; and
I crept away, in extremely low spirits, to tell Oliver
of the fate that was in store for me.
</p>

<p>
'I need not tell minutely of all the days which
followed before the time of my departure arrived.  They
seemed to me to be few enough, and to fly past with
a rapidity that was quite dreadful.  I spent most of
them in visiting all my favourite spots in the park and
garden&mdash;in saying good-bye to everybody, high and
low, around Horsemandown&mdash;and in giving Oliver
minute directions as to the health and treatment of
my many pets.  I will leave you to imagine my
farewells, and take up my story six months after
my arrival at that dreaded school, where happened
all the adventures which make my history worth
hearing.'

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br><br>
LADY GREENSLEEVES' STORY (CONTINUED).
</h3>

<p class="t3">
<i>The Maids of Taunton.</i>
</p>

<p>
Madame St. Aubert's young ladies were in
the schoolroom one bright June morning,
putting away books, inkstands, samplers,
etc., with great energy and despatch; for
both the clock of the old parish church, and the
sun-dial on the terrace walk beneath the schoolroom
windows, announced that morning lesson hours were over.
That hour of freedom before dinner-time was always
eagerly welcomed by us.  But it had been longed for
even more than usual this morning, for there was
something new to be talked over amongst us
to-day,&mdash;something which, in our opinion, was exciting and
mysterious to a very high degree.  In the first place,
Madame St. Aubert had been called out of the room
in the middle of a French lesson by one of the maids,
and we were sure that some extremely interesting
piece of news must have been imparted to her outside
the door; for we could hear her exclamations of
surprise and (as we fancied) alarm quite distinctly at first,
though afterwards they sank into a much lower key.
Then a buzz of voices was heard on the stairs: the
quick, decided tones of our old vicar, Dr. Power, and
the rather shrill and plaintive ones of little Monsieur
Guillemard, from whom Madame St. Aubert's young
ladies learned the gavotte, coranto, and many other
stiff, elaborate dances that were fashionable at the
court in those days.  This was not the time for
Monsieur Guillemard's lesson, nor was Dr. Power in
the habit of calling so early.  Something out of the
common way must, doubtless, have happened; and
there were we, obliged to sit demurely at our desks,
with closed lips, only able to exchange eager glances
of curiosity, and listen with straining ears to the
subdued murmur on the staircase.  Pauline, Madame
St. Aubert's daughter, and Mrs. Fortescue, a lady next in
command to Madame herself, were evidently no less
curious than we were; for the former opened her black
eyes very wide indeed, and arched her eyebrows
significantly; while the latter frowned, bit her lips, and
took up the French lesson where Madame had broken
off, raising her voice meanwhile, and pretending not
to hear the buzz outside the door, though she could not
help casting from time to time an anxious glance in
that direction.  Presently Madame St. Aubert came
back, looking much flushed and excited, but she only
remarked to her daughter something about Dr. Power
having wished to wait upon her for a few moments;
and then the morning studies went on in their usual
course, without further interruption.  You will not
wonder after this, that scarcely a third of the usual
time was spent in putting the schoolroom in order.
When this task was accomplished at last, we poured
out into the garden, and settled down like a flock of
sparrows on the soft turf under the lime tree; for the
sun was very hot that morning, and the pleasantest
spot in the garden was beneath the shade of those
widely-spreading, pale green branches.  A most unusual
thing it was to have anything approaching to an event
about which to puzzle our curious brains; for time
used to go on very monotonously at Madame
St. Aubert's,&mdash;monotonously, but at the same time not in
the least slowly or heavily.  There were too many of
us, and we were too busy all day to be dull.  Nevertheless,
we were quite ready to catch at any fresh little
piece of excitement that chanced to break in upon the
sameness of the day.  So there we sat, under the lime
tree, and discussed the mystery, as we called it, of the
morning.  But though we chattered to our hearts'
content, no conclusion could be reached concerning it.
There was something against every suggestion offered.
Agnes Blount thought that Madame must have heard
of the death of some of her French relations; but if so,
why should she only look excited and startled&mdash;not
in the least melancholy or tearful?  And Madames'
tears were well known to be ready, and abundant, too,
on the smallest possible occasion.  Lucy Fordyce was
of opinion that she might have lost some large sum of
money,&mdash;perhaps all her fortune,&mdash;and that Dr. Power
had come to break the news to her.  There was the
same objection, however, to this as to Agnes's idea
about the French relations.  Besides, Monsieur Guillemard
was not a likely person to bring tidings of such
a misfortune.  Bessie Davenant was sure that the
King must be dead; but this notion was instantly
scouted as more improbable than any, for Madame
would of course have proclaimed that piece of news
on the spot, and ordered us to impress the date of such
an important historical fact on our minds, as she had
done when King Charles died, four months since&mdash;February
6th 1685.  I never forgot that date to the
last day of my life.  How I longed to prompt Robin
when Miss Gregory asked him one day on the stairs
to tell her when King Charles II. died, and he couldn't
answer!  Well! we were still making conjectures, each
one more wild and improbable than the last, when
Pauline St. Aubert was seen tripping down the steps
of the terrace.  Now, Pauline was a great favourite
among her pupils, especially the elder girls, some of
whom were but little younger than herself; and as she
was the very essence of good nature, and had never
been known to keep a secret for more than half an
hour at the utmost, we no sooner caught sight of her
trim, graceful little figure approaching the lime tree,
than we felt sure that the news, whatever it might be,
was already ours.
</p>

<p>
'"Pauline!  Pauline!  The person above all others
that we wanted!" cried Bessie Davenant, one of the
bosom friends who were allowed to call Mademoiselle
St. Aubert by her Christian name.  Only three of us
enjoyed that privilege, and these were Henrietta
Sidney, Bessie Davenant, and Eleanor Page.  We
younger ones only ventured upon "Mademoiselle!"  In
a moment we were all upon our feet and gathered
round Pauline; but, to our dismay, she had nothing
to tell us, after all.  Not that she had been seized
with a sudden fit of discretion, but she was evidently
perfectly ignorant of the matter, and quite as curious
and as much perplexed about it as we were ourselves.
</p>

<p>
'"Indeed I am not a whit wiser than the rest of
you," she said, laughing.  "Mamma has not taken
me into her confidence, I assure you.  I did just
venture to ask her whether it was ill news that had
brought Dr. Power so early in the day, but she only
chid me for being curious about what was no business
of mine, and said that Dr. Power had come to take
counsel with her on some matter that needed not my
help."
</p>

<p>
'"How very strange!" cried Bessie, much aggrieved
and disappointed.  "But something is going on,
Pauline.  There can be no doubt about that, and I
shall never rest till we have found out what it is."
</p>

<p>
'"Something!  Yes, indeed!" echoed Pauline.
"Do you know there is a strange man closeted in the
little north parlour with mamma and Dr. Power?  The
door was ajar when I passed, and I saw him&mdash;a little,
dark man, with a soldier-like bearing, I thought; but
I had not time to see much, for he scowled at me quite
savagely, and shut the door in a moment."
</p>

<p>
'There was a chorus of exclamations at this
adventure of Pauline's.  A little, dark man!&mdash;a
stranger!&mdash;and soldier-like in bearing!&mdash;who shut the
door with a ferocious scowl!  This was a charming
addition to our mystery; and Pauline was questioned
and cross-questioned to a degree that no one else
could have borne without losing patience.  But she
only laughed and shook her head, declaring that she
had told us all she knew, and (she feared) a great deal
more than she ought.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh! mamma was right," she said, throwing herself
lazily on to the turf seat that went round the lime
tree.  "She knows that a secret is as sure to come
out, if I have the keeping of it, as sand out of a sieve.
But, oh! you are all so terribly curious, and I am such
a 'bavarde.'  Ah! well, never mind.  We shall hear
all about it in time, doubtless.  Oh Frances, what a
rent in your ruffle!  What will Mrs. Fortescue say if
she finds it out?"
</p>

<p>
'Pauline's words made me colour, and look down
rather disconsolately at the ruffle in question, for I
knew well enough what Mrs. Fortescue would say.
Her commands, as we were leaving the schoolroom,
had been, that Lady Desmond should not appear
before her eyes again until that ruffle was mended;
and Mrs. Fortescue's commands were not to be lightly
treated.  We stood in far more awe of her than of
Madame St. Aubert herself; and I had not the least
doubt that, if the dinner-bell rang before her orders
were obeyed, I should be condemned to solitary
banishment in the schoolroom while the other girls
were enjoying their walk in the cool of the evening.
</p>

<p>
'"Poor child!  How woeful she looks!" cried Bessie
Davenant compassionately.  "Never mind, Frances,
I'll come and help you.  There is time before dinner,
if we run in at once, trusting to good luck not to meet
Mrs. Fortescue by the way;" and Bessie, whose course
of action was always prompt and decided, on account
of her never waiting to think about anything, caught
my hand, and we sped together across the lawn, and
along the sunny terrace walk into the house, never
pausing till we sank panting upon a bench in the
schoolroom.  We had sat there for a moment in
silence, to recover our breath, when the sound of
Mrs. Fortescue's voice made me give a guilty start, and
glance at Bessie in alarm.  The door was ajar of a
little ante-room which opened into the schoolroom
("Madame's own closet," we used to call it), and
Madame St. Aubert was there now.  We could hear
her voice, though we could not catch the words; but
Mrs. Fortescue's was not pitched in so low a key.
</p>

<p>
'"The Duke of Monmouth!" we heard her exclaim,
"will set foot, do you say, on English ground in two
days?  Then God save him, poor youth, and help
him to his own rightful kingdom.  But what a fearful
struggle..."
</p>

<p>
'Bessie and I had been staring at one another for
the last few moments in motionless surprise; but here,
by mutual consent, we rose, and were about to slip
quietly back to the door by which we had entered,
when another voice cut short Mrs. Fortescue's speech,
and brought us for an instant to a sudden standstill.
This was a man's voice, and a very harsh and unrefined
one, too, which certainly belonged to none of the few
men whom Madame St. Aubert was wont to admit to
her house.
</p>

<p>
'"Pardon, Madame," it said rather gruffly, "but I
must pray you to be somewhat less loud.  Remember
whose life and fortune is at stake.  This is no child's
play, Madame, let me tell you!"
</p>

<p>
'At this juncture I pulled Bessie's dress, and, while
the colour rushed into her face, she turned, and we
stole softly from the room.  I do not think either of
us breathed freely till we found ourselves again in the
garden, and safe from view in a shady, winding path,
through a tangled confusion of shrubs and trees, which
went by the name of "The Wilderness."  As for myself,
I had scarcely yet realized what a secret it was
that we two had found out,&mdash;what those words meant
that had come to our ears during the few moments
when, astonished and taken aback, we paused and
listened to what we had no right to hear.  But
their significance was clear enough to Bessie, for she
had lived five years longer in the world than I had,
and was a little more learned in the news of the day.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh Frances!" she exclaimed, looking half
frightened, half triumphant, "what have we done!  What
would Madame say if she knew what we have heard?
But oh! to think that the mystery should prove to
be this.  What glorious news!  Oh, if I were only a
man, to be with him!  Alack! alack!" and Bessie
leaned against an apple tree, and vented her
excitement in a tremendous sigh.
</p>

<p>
'"But, Bessie, why?  Do tell me.  I didn't quite
understand," I cried, feeling eager and excited too in
a high degree, and quite ready to be as enthusiastic
as Bessie herself&mdash;only, somewhat bewildered as to
who was going to set foot on English ground, and
why there should be such a commotion about him.
</p>

<p>
'"Hush! who is that?" said Bessie with a start, at
the sound of approaching footsteps; and, even as she
spoke, Henrietta Sidney came in sight, sauntering up
the shady path.
</p>

<p>
'"Well, Frances, is the ruffle mended already?"
she began, but stopped short at the sight of Bessie's
flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes.  "Something is
the matter," she remarked at length, in her gentle,
composed, perhaps rather languid way.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh Henrietta!" exclaimed Bessie, springing
forward and seizing both her hands; "if it is only
you, I don't care.  Yes, indeed, something is the matter.
Such glorious tidings!  The secret is out.  And what
do you think?  The Duke of Monmouth is going to
land in two days and claim his crown; and we shall
have another civil war, to a certainty!  There is that
strange man that Pauline spoke of; but now, instead
of the north parlour, he is in Madame's closet, talking
to her and Mrs. Fortescue.  Why he should come to
tell them, I cannot imagine&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"But, Bessie, do stop one moment," interrupted
Henrietta imploringly, "is this really true?  And how
did you find it out?  This mysterious man did not
surely confide all this to you and Frances!"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh no, no; they never meant us to hear it, of
course."  And Bessie and I hereupon poured out an
explanation of how we had chanced to learn this
wonderful piece of intelligence.  Henrietta made no comment
as she listened, but her face grew thoughtful and
troubled.  She evidently did not look at the affair
quite in the same light that Bessie did.
</p>

<p>
'"And now, Henrietta," I began eagerly, when we
had finished our story, "I want to know what they
meant about the Duke of Monmouth, and why he is
coming to England."
</p>

<p>
'"Hush!" she said in a tone that, for her, was
almost sharp.  And I was silenced directly; for, in
spite of Henrietta's indolent, gentle manner, there was
something about her now and then that made me feel
slightly afraid of her.  In fact I think that all the
girls had a great respect for her judgment, though
she was rather cold and shy, and by no means such
a favourite among them as Bessie, or Pauline St. Aubert.
</p>

<p>
'"Indeed, Frances," she said earnestly, "you must
not speak of this to any one else.  You ought not to
have told me.  I wish, with all my heart, that we all
knew as little of it now as we did half an hour ago."
</p>

<p>
'"But why?" asked Bessie, looking both crestfallen
and alarmed at this view of the matter; for her
excitement was a good deal damped by Henrietta's anxious
tone and serious face.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh Bessie, don't you see?  In the first place, you
had no right to hear this, much less to tell me about
it; and I cannot help feeling as if we were doing
something dishonourable and underhand in knowing
it at all.  Besides, as the man himself said, this is no
child's play.  It seems to me that it must be a really
weighty secret, which may bring Madame St. Aubert,
and perhaps even us, into trouble some day."
</p>

<p>
'"Nonsense!" Bessie broke in impatiently; "you
always were so discreet and cautious, Henrietta.  'Tis
a marvel to me how you can talk in such a cold,
selfish, heartless way.  Why, even if it were to bring
us into trouble&mdash;which is not likely at all&mdash;I should
be proud to go through a little danger for such a
cause."
</p>

<p>
'"Such a cause!" repeated Henrietta, with a
slightly sarcastic smile.  "Well, I don't know," she
continued relapsing into her peculiarly low, deliberate
tone; "but even if the cause were a right one, I
should think another civil war would do more harm
than good.  My father has often told me stories
about the last, and what he and my grandmother used
to go through; and I do not want another to come
in my time.  No, Bessie, I call your tidings anything
but glorious."
</p>

<p>
'"My dear Henrietta, I do not believe there will be
a civil war at all.  Depend upon it, all the country
will flock to join the Duke of Monmouth.  He is so
much more popular than the King; and he is brave
and handsome, and his manners are so gracious.
Besides, he is going to defend the Protestant religion;
and it is a well-known thing that King James wants
to turn us all into Papists, and make bonfires of every
body, just as cruel Queen Mary did."
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta knitted her forehead, in order, I suppose,
the better to ponder the subject; and slowly plucked
to pieces, leaf by leaf, a York and Lancaster rose that
she wore in her sash.
</p>

<p>
'"I suppose," she said at length, with a little sigh,
as she raised her head, "that, in truth, neither of us
knows much about the matter.  We only think as we
have been taught to think at home.  All I know is,
what my father used to say about the Duke of
Monmouth,&mdash;that he has no right to the throne whatever,
and that, even if he were to get it, he has not wit
enough to keep it; and also, that he is a bad, unprincipled
man, who cares as little for the Protestant faith
as for any other."
</p>

<p>
'"Then your father judges him very harshly and
untruly, and can know nothing about him," cried
Bessie, firing up in high indignation.  "My uncle
is his great friend, and I have often heard him say
that the Duke of Monmouth is a stanch Protestant,
and a man of honour, and far more noble and princely
than the King."
</p>

<p>
'To this Henrietta made no reply, and at first I
thought she was offended, and going off wrathfully
without another word, for she turned away and moved
a few steps up the shrubbery; then, after a moment's
hesitation, she came back and laid her hand upon
Bessie's arm.
</p>

<p>
'"Listen to me, Bess.  I don't wish to quarrel
about the Duke of Monmouth or anybody else; but
in this we shall agree, I warrant: Madame St. Aubert
ought to be told that we have found out this secret
of hers.  I am heartily sorry that you chanced to
overhear it; but, since we have discovered it, and in this
way too (which is a somewhat crooked one, I must
say), I think the only straightforward thing to do is
to go at once and tell her simply what we know, and
how we knew it."
</p>

<p>
'Bessie opened her eyes very wide, and turned them
with a quick, startled look upon Henrietta.  "Well, I
am ready," she said, the next moment, making up her
mind, as usual, without the smallest hesitation.  "You
are quite right, Henrietta.  It is but fair that Madame
should know.  It was shameful in me not to have
spoken to her at the time.  Come, Frances, we will go
to her at once, and tell her that the Duke of Monmouth's
secret is safe, at least as far as you and I are
concerned;" and Bessie drew up her head proudly, and,
throwing her arm round my waist, marched majestically
through The Wilderness with a sort of defiant air, as
if prepared to undertake the Duke of Monmouth's
defence against his enemies in general, and Henrietta
in particular.  I, for my part, stepped along by Bessie's
side, trying to look equally fearless and defiant, and
feeling ready to stand by her through thick and thin;
for we two were great friends, notwithstanding the five
years' difference in our ages.  As to the right or wrong
of the question, I did not bestow a thought upon that,
my ideas upon politics being vague to the last degree.
I suppose no child in the kingdom, at that time, knew
less about the events taking place in it than I did.  I
had seldom or never heard political subjects discussed
at home, for mamma certainly hardly ever talked of
them, and, I fancy, thought very little about them
either; and even when my father was at Horsemandown,
I saw so little of him or his friends that I had
not the remotest notion as to what his opinions were.
However, I was fond of Bessie, and Bessie believed in
the Duke of Monmouth,&mdash;and that was enough for
me; so I made up my mind to believe in him too.
Nevertheless, I could not quite get rid of the
impression which Henrietta's words had made.  She had
never been in the habit of taking much notice of me,
or indeed of any of the younger girls; and we used to
laugh at her languid, sleepy manner, and declare that
Henrietta had no feelings&mdash;that the shock of an
earthquake, or news that the great plague had broken out
again in Taunton, would scarcely make her take the
trouble of lifting her eyes from her book, or rising
from her chair.  I daresay she was quite aware of
these jokes of ours, and that they did not help to make
her less cold and indifferent towards us; but, for all
this, one of Henrietta's quiet, lazily spoken remarks
had often more weight with us than the most decided
and strongly expressed opinions of the other girls.
I looked back at her as she walked behind Bessie and
me up the shrubbery.  She was grave, and rather
white, and though she had urged us to make this
confession to Madame St. Aubert, I saw that she
was going with intense reluctance, and entirely
because she considered it a matter of honour and duty.
</p>

<p>
'"Are they still there?" whispered Bessie as we
opened the schoolroom door and looked anxiously
in the direction of Madame's closet.  Yes! there they
were still, without doubt; but the door was no longer
ajar, and only an indistinct murmur of voices was
audible from within.  But as we lingered, hesitating
what step next to take, the ante-room door opened,
and Madame St. Aubert came forth, followed by
Mrs. Fortescue and the stranger, whom Pauline had justly
described as "a little, dark man, with a soldier-like
bearing."  Soldier-like it certainly was, but not
the bearing of a gentleman.  Indeed there was
something about him which struck me, at the first glance,
as low, unrefined, and decidedly disagreeable.
</p>

<p>
'Madame stopped short at the sight of us, for it was
most unusual to find any of the girls in the school-room
at that hour; and she looked considerably taken
aback, and by no means pleased.  As for the stranger,
after staring at us for a moment in a most cool,
insolent way, he turned, with a frown, to Madame
St. Aubert, saying: "It seems to me, Madame, that one
may scarce hope for privacy in your house for more
than ten minutes at a time.  And, pray, who may
those young gentlewomen be?"
</p>

<p>
'There was something so peremptory and familiar in
his way of speaking, that all three of the said young
gentlewomen felt inexpressibly ruffled and indignant;
but Henrietta's cheeks were burning, and I never had
imagined before that her large, sleepy, grey eyes
could look so absolutely fierce as they did for a
moment just then.
</p>

<p>
'"Girls, what are you doing here at this hour?
Why are you not in the garden with the rest?" asked
Madame St. Aubert, without answering the strange
man's question.  She glanced at us sharply, and somewhat
suspiciously, as if the idea had entered her mind
that we might possibly have been listening to the
conversation in the ante-room.  There was a minute's
silence, while Madame, annoyed and impatient, stood
waiting for an answer.
</p>

<p>
'What a privilege I felt it then to be the youngest
of the party!  I drew back as far behind the others
as I could, and twitched Bessie's dress.  But though,
as I said before, Bessie never stayed to think twice ere
she set about an undertaking, she was not always
quite so prompt in finishing it.  Now and then things
would suddenly prove too much for her, and she
would break down helplessly before her schemes
could be carried out.  Now I pulled her dress without
producing the slightest effect.  It was clear that, if
Madame St. Aubert was to be told of our discovery
at all, Henrietta must be the person to do it.  So,
seeing that there was no help for it, she came forward,
and speaking, evidently with a great effort, and in a
rather husky voice, she gave a very short, but very
clear, explanation of how matters stood.  Meanwhile
Madame St. Aubert looked every moment more and
more perplexed and angry, and the mysterious man
bit his lip and growled wrathfully to himself.  I
thought his ejaculations sounded uncommonly like
oaths, only they were, fortunately, somewhat indistinct.
</p>

<p>
'"I warned you how it would be, Madame," said
he bluntly, nodding with a sarcastic smile towards Mrs
Fortescue, when Henrietta had finished her story.
"You lack discretion, Madame&mdash;discretion&mdash;like most
women.  I crave pardon, but I cannot but say so.
What with loud speaking, and doors left ajar, here
are three babbling children acquainted with a matter
which you solemnly promised should be kept strictly
secret."
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-098"></a>
<br>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-098.jpg" alt="'YOU LACK DISCRETION, MADAME--DISCRETION--LIKE MOST WOMEN.'">
<br>
'YOU LACK DISCRETION, MADAME&mdash;DISCRETION&mdash;LIKE MOST WOMEN.'
</p>

<p>
'Poor Madame St. Aubert looked round distractedly.
It was plain that she was very angry, and wished to
pour forth her anger upon somebody, but could not
make up her mind whether it should fall upon the
head of this extremely plain-spoken gentleman,
Mrs. Fortescue, or "those three babbling girls," her pupils.
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Fortescue, however, though she might know
herself in the wrong, was not a person to be easily
browbeaten.  "Very well, Colonel Dare," quoth she
with severity; "and, craving your pardon, I must
needs say that your courtesy is as scant as you deem
our discretion.  You would do well, sir, to learn
something of chivalry from his Grace of Monmouth.  He
would not speak to the wife of one of his troopers in
such a tone as you have used to us."
</p>

<p>
'This reproof seemed considerably to abash Colonel
Dare; for his face grew very red&mdash;indeed I may almost
say purple&mdash;and he muttered, in a stammering,
confused kind of way, something about being a rough,
honest soldier&mdash;not used to ladies' presence, and never
thinking to give offence&mdash;only, somewhat hot in his
zeal for the great cause; which excuses appeared in
some degree to appease Mrs. Fortescue's wrath, and
Madame's perplexity and distress.  They evidently both
wished to be on good terms with this odd, churlish, little
Colonel Dare&mdash;Madame St. Aubert especially.
</p>

<p>
'"Come, come, Monsieur," she said, with a graceful
little wave of the hand, "you have said quite
enough.  You have made 'l'amende honorable.'  I
have no doubt that Mrs. Fortescue is satisfied, and
that we all understand one another perfectly.  But
now let me intreat you to set your mind at rest.  I
can assure you that these young ladies will not betray
us.  Is it not so, mes petites?  You will give me each
your word of honour to say nothing of this news
that you have heard, until you have my permission.
It can be but two or three days more before it will be
known to the whole kingdom."
</p>

<p>
'"With all my heart, Madame," Bessie cried, springing
forward in her impetuous way, her pretty bright
face glowing with eagerness and enthusiasm.  "There
is nothing I would wish for more than to serve the
Duke; and I would rather die a thousand deaths than
say a word which could harm him!"
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! bravo! bravo! young mistress," exclaimed
Colonel Dare, who had been surveying Bessie with a
curious, critical gaze for some moments.  "I see you
are one of us.  We have no fear of you.  But this
little lady here, what has she to say for herself?"
and he glanced doubtfully from me to Madame St. Aubert.
</p>

<p>
'"I think she may be trusted," Madame said, smiling
a little, and holding out her hand to me.  "When one
is already a wife, one ought to be discreet enough to
keep a secret; eh, Frances?  Yes, I think we may
trust Lady Desmond!"
</p>

<p>
'These words made me altogether forget my shyness
and my fright, and I ran to Madame St. Aubert's side,
exclaiming as enthusiastically as Bessie herself: "Oh
yes; indeed, Madame, you may trust me; and I
would do anything to serve the Duke of Monmouth
too, if I could&mdash;just as much as Bessie would."  They
all began to laugh at this speech (except Henrietta)&mdash;even
the sour-looking Colonel Dare, which rather
hurt my feelings, for I was quite in earnest, and really
began to feel myself a loyal and devoted follower of
the Duke of Monmouth, though, until the last hour, I
had scarcely heard more of him than his name.
</p>

<p>
'"And Henrietta?" asked Madame St. Aubert
gently, though at the same time with a shade of
uneasiness in her tone&mdash;"But I scarce need call for your
promise.  You are no babbler, as we all surely know."
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta, however, made no answer.  She had
stood for the last few minutes with eyes fixed absently
on the window, seeming to take no notice whatever of
anything that was passing.  Her mouth twitched
nervously, and she was knitting her brows, as if trying
to think out something that both puzzled and worried
her a good deal.
</p>

<p>
'"Well, Henrietta?" demanded Mrs. Fortescue impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'"You will give us your word," said Madame, with
her most persuasive smile; and then Henrietta roused
herself with a little sigh, and gave the promise required,
repeating Madame St. Aubert's own words: "Yes,
Madame, I give you my word of honour to say nothing
of this matter, until I have your permission."
</p>

<p>
'There was so much effort and reluctance in her
tone as she said this, that Colonel Dare's fierce little
black eyes were turned upon her with a distrustful
glance.  "If you follow my counsel, Madame," said
he, "you will request young mistress here to give that
pledge again with her hand upon the Bible."
</p>

<p>
'Once more Henrietta's face lighted up with
indignation.  "I have given my promise already, sir," she
said proudly.  "May I go, Madame?" and scarcely
waiting for Madame St. Aubert's nod of assent, she
made her courtesy and left the room.
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! never fear.  She is safe enough," said Madame
reassuringly.  "Henrietta's promise is as good as an oath."
</p>

<p>
'A doubtful "Humph!" was Colonel Dare's only
reply; after which came the abrupt question: "Pray,
who is she?"
</p>

<p>
'"One of the Gloucestershire Sidneys.  A daughter
of Mr. Sidney of Nettlewood."
</p>

<p>
'"James Sidney of Nettlewood!" Colonel Dare
scowled more disagreeably than ever as he repeated
this name.  "That speaks for itself.  The Duke and
he have but little love lost between them.  I suppose
that proud, sullen-looking damsel of his is not likely
to have any intercourse with her father just now?"
</p>

<p>
'Madame St. Aubert again assured him of Henrietta's
trustworthiness, and then went on to explain all about
the family and connections of Bessie and myself.  I
was astonished to find how much he had already heard
of me and my history.  Indeed he seemed, I thought,
to know quite as much, if not more than I did myself,
of my father, Sir Harry Mountfort, and my young
husband, Lord Desmond.  At Sir Harry's name, both
he and Madame St. Aubert shook their heads
ominously.  "No hope of him&mdash;not a jot," they
pronounced.  "Hand and glove with the King; and the
young Earl Desmond a minor, and of course wholly
under his guardian's influence for the present."  But
of my father they spoke far less despondingly.  Why,
I could not imagine; for, as I remarked before, I had
not the smallest idea of what his political opinions
might be.  Colonel Dare, however, seemed to have
some reason for thinking that my father was inclined
to favour the Duke of Monmouth's claims; and he
made one or two attempts to find out whether I had
ever heard anything let fall by him upon the subject;
but discovering in a very little while how utterly
ignorant I was, he ceased questioning me, and turned to
Bessie, who was ready enough to answer anything
that he chose to ask.  She had been brought up by
her uncle, Sir Geoffrey Davenant, a Somersetshire
knight, living not many miles from Taunton; and it
was in his house that she had learned her ardent
devotion to the Duke of Monmouth.  Sir Geoffrey's
political principles were apparently as well known to
the shrewd Colonel Dare as those of Henrietta's father
and mine; and he seemed very well satisfied with
what he drew from Bessie concerning her uncle and
her uncle's friends.
</p>

<p>
'"If I should chance to see Sir Geoffrey before many
days are out, I shall tell him that his kinswoman's
heart is with us," was Colonel Dare's parting speech
to Bessie when Madame St. Aubert at last dismissed us.
"Oh, if I were only as rich as Henrietta, or Eleanor
Page!"  So exclaimed Bessie, as we ran up-stairs
into the great bed-chamber where the six elder girls
slept.  None of them were there at present; and Bessie
sat down upon her own bed, with one arm thrown
round me, sighing out again, "If I was but as rich as
Henrietta!"
</p>

<p>
'"Why do you want to be rich, Bessie?  Do you
want money so much just now?"
</p>

<p>
'"How can you ask, child?  That I may give it all
to him, to be sure."
</p>

<p>
'"To that Colonel Dare?"
</p>

<p>
'"No, no.  To the Duke, of course.  But Colonel
Dare would take it to him."
</p>

<p>
'"Bessie!  To the Duke!  But what does he want
it for?  Besides, hasn't he plenty of money of his
own?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh Frances, you are such a child!  How is he
to raise soldiers without money?  He must feed his
army, and buy arms and horses and everything; and
from what I have heard my uncle say, I suspect he
has by no means more money than he wants, especially
for such an enterprise as this.  I should not wonder
if that was what that gentleman wanted of Madame
St. Aubert.  She has a very good fortune, I know."
</p>

<p>
'These were quite new ideas to me, and rather
surprising ones too; for, never having studied the
subject deeply, I had always held a kind of vague
belief that dukes, as a matter of course, had gold and
silver to any amount they chose; while the fact that
armies must eat, and that soldiers must be paid
for fighting, had somehow never struck me before.
</p>

<p>
'"Frances, have you any money?" Bessie asked,
rising suddenly, and opening a chest by the bedside.
"Look!  This is all I have left: not much, but it
shall go to him.  I know my uncle would give me
more if I were really in need of it."
</p>

<p>
'She turned out the contents of a little Spanish
leather purse upon the bed.  There were three golden
guineas, a crown piece, and a few small silver coins.
It certainly did not look a very magnificent sum as it
lay spread out upon the quilt; nor did my contribution
make it much more imposing, for my whole store
was but one double guinea piece, which I had meant
to spend on presents for the boys, to be given when I
went home at Christmas.  But now I was fast catching
Bessie's zeal.  Who could think of Christmas
presents in comparison with a great cause like this?
I felt quite sure that Oliver would enter into my view
of the case, if he could be consulted; so I laid my gold
piece beside Bessie's, and we looked at them for a few
minutes in solemn silence, which I was the first to
interrupt.
</p>

<p>
'"I suppose Henrietta would not help us?"
</p>

<p>
'"Not she, forsooth!" said Bessie, with a contemptuous
curl of the lip.  "Nothing would induce me to
ask her.  But if we tarry so long, Colonel Dare will be
gone.  Many thanks to you, sweetheart, for what you
have given;" and gathering up the little heap, Bessie
put it into the purse, and tripped down-stairs with all
possible speed.  I leaned over the balustrade, and
watched her as she met Madame St. Aubert and her
visitor outside the study door, and I saw her blush and
smile as he took the purse and raised her hand to his
lips.  Colonel Dare took his departure hastily, for all
the girls from the garden were beginning to pour in,
and the great bell was ringing for dinner.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
'Three days had passed by, and Bessie, Henrietta,
and I still kept our secret.  I thought them rather
pleasant days myself, for I was extremely proud of the
important piece of knowledge which Madame St. Aubert
had been involuntarily obliged to leave in my
keeping.  But I do not know that the two others
wholly shared this opinion.  Certainly Henrietta did
not.  She looked more and more grave and oppressed,
and never spoke of the subject to either of us; while
Bessie was in such a fever of expectation that it was
all she could do to keep up her self-command before
the other girls.  Whenever we could manage it, she
and I used to get alone together, and talk about the
only subject that now had any interest for us.  When
should we hear the news of Monmouth's landing? would
he be likely to march near Taunton? and
would Bessie's uncle, Sir Geoffrey Davenant, take up
arms in his behalf?  These were the questions which
we asked ourselves at least a dozen times a day; and
I drank in Bessie's doctrines without a thought of
disputing them, till I was becoming heart and soul as
rebellious a little subject of King James as she was
herself.  I should probably have found it much harder
to keep my lips sealed to the rest of the household, if
there had been no Bessie with whom to chatter freely
about the secret; and I have no doubt I was equally
useful to her in enabling her to give a vent to her
feelings.
</p>

<p>
'We two had always been friends from that first
dismal winter's night when I first arrived at Madame
St. Aubert's, a tearful, disconsolate little bride, tired
out with the long, cold journey, and most unhappy at
leaving&mdash;not the husband whom I had known for a
day, but home, mamma, and my brothers; not to
mention all the animals, that I cared for only next to
them.  Yes, that was a very miserable night to me;
and I must confess that what added a sharp sting to
my grief was the feeling of intense mortification at
having to come down from the dignified position
which I had held of late and so thoroughly enjoyed.
A few days ago I was the most important person in
the house,&mdash;treated with all the honour and attention
due to a bride, and almost as if I were a woman; and
now, here I was, only a little girl again, at school
among strangers, and conscious of being younger and
smaller than most of my companions, and not equal
to any of them in good manners and accomplishments.
How kind Bessie was to me that night!  It was her
bright winning manner and good-natured words that
first began to set me at ease; and during my early
school-days, whenever a home-sick fit of crying
came over me, I always went to Bessie to be petted
and comforted.  That intense home-sickness had been
over now for a long time.  To be sure, I looked
forward eagerly to the next Christmas, when I was to be
at Horsemandown once more; but I had grown used
to the routine of Madame St. Aubert's house by this
time, and found myself much happier at school than
I could once have imagined possible.  Mrs. Fortescue
was sharp and severe, sometimes, it is true; but
Madame St. Aubert was, in general, remarkably kind
to her pupils,&mdash;far more gentle and indulgent than
most governesses of those days were wont to be.  I
did not dislike the studies either; though I must say
we were somewhat hardly worked, and spent a great
deal more time over them than would be considered
wholesome in a schoolroom of the present time,&mdash;in
the Horsemandown schoolroom, at all events.  The
learning to dance, to speak French, and to play upon
the harp and virginals, was what I liked best; and I
soon began to get on very well in those
accomplishments&mdash;especially the music and dancing&mdash;and to
discover that Agnes Blount's skill in them might not
be so hopelessly beyond my reach, after all.  My
schoolfellows, too, I liked very much on the whole;
and I think that on their part they had rather a respect
for me&mdash;especially those of my own age&mdash;on account
of my being, child as I was, already a wife, and wife
to the Earl of Desmond.  It seemed strange, even
then, that among the pupils should be numbered a
bride, and that she should be one of the youngest
of all; but still not half so strange as if it
were nowadays; for, according to a very common
custom in those times, several of the girls were
betrothed, and one or two of them had been so from
babyhood.  Well, but to continue my story.  For three
days, as I said, we had kept our secret.  The excitement
of the girls about Madame's "mystery," as they
chose to call it, was beginning to go off.  In fact it
was fast fading away, in the interest of a scheme, started
by Pauline, for getting up a little French masque, to be
acted on her mother's birthday, or, as Pauline called it,
her "fête."  One morning, however, it happened that,
although when Madame St. Aubert's fourteen young
ladies sat down to breakfast the projected masque
was uppermost in the minds of eleven of them, yet
before their basins of milk were empty it had gone
out of their heads altogether; and this was the reason:
"Dr. Power begs permission to wait upon you,
Madame," was a message that made every one look
up in surprise.  Half-past six was so very early for
Dr. Power, who was celebrated for his late rising.
Madame St. Aubert rose hurriedly from her chair,
but before she could leave the table the Doctor
himself peered in at the open door.
</p>

<p>
'"Too anxious to announce my news to await your
summons, Madame," said he, with an apologetic bow
so profound that his flowing wig almost swept the
floor.  "Ladies, you must pardon me for this intrusion;
but when I tell you that the Duke of Monmouth has
landed at Lyme&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Landed at Lyme!" cried Madame St. Aubert,
exultingly echoed by Mrs. Fortescue and Bessie.
</p>

<p>
'"The Duke of Monmouth!" repeated Pauline in
tones of astonishment, while the young ladies all put
down their spoons and opened their eyes; and
murmurs of "Oh!" "Who?" "Where?" "What for?"
ran round the table.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, landed yesterday morning at Lyme," Dr. Power
proceeded, after a loud and violent fit of coughing,
which seemed much to exasperate Bessie.  "I
only heard the news this morning.  They say he was
at the head of more than a thousand men last night,
and by this time, I warrant me, all Dorsetshire and
Devonshire will have joined him.  It was Dare who
sent me word.  He left this place at two o'clock this
morning, with a troop of forty horsemen behind him;
thanks to your liberality, Madame."  (Here Bessie
glanced at me significantly.)  "'Tis only a handful, to
be sure," continued Dr. Power, "but he'll pick up more
on the road.  There's a piece of news for you, young
ladies!" he rattled on, rubbing his hands and nodding
triumphantly; "and a piece of news for King James
too (not that he will be king much longer).  Ah, I
should like to know what <i>he</i> thinks of the business!"
</p>

<p>
'"Well, but, Dr. Power," cried Madame at last
impatiently, for she had already made two vain attempts
to strike in, and would not have managed to do so
now had not Dr. Power's breath at last given way
altogether,&mdash;"tell us some more details.  How was
he received in the place?  Was there no opposition
made to his landing?"
</p>

<p>
'"Opposition?  None whatever.  He was received
most enthusiastically.  The whole town was ringing
with shouts of 'A Monmouth!  A Monmouth!  God
save Monmouth and the Protestant religion!'  Then
up went his blue flag in the market-place, and his
Declaration was read from the town-cross."
</p>

<p>
'At this point Bessie could not resist clapping her
hands, and was even heard to utter a smothered
"Hurrah."
</p>

<p>
'"And he proclaimed himself King?" asked Mrs. Fortescue.
</p>

<p>
'"No, no; not yet.  He is prudent enough to put
that off for a bit.  He declares that his right to the
throne shall be decided by a free Parliament; but he
denounces his uncle for a tyrant, usurper, murderer,
and I know not what beside.  (Somewhat too strong
in language this Declaration must be, to my thinking.)  Well,
and then he claims to be champion and leader
of all English Protestants."
</p>

<p>
'"And so he is, without doubt," cried Madame
St. Aubert, clasping her hands vehemently.  "He will
save us all from being made Papists, whether we will
or no, or perchance burned alive at Smithfield.  Ah
yes!  Mark my words, Dr. Power.  He is the only man
to save England, and all England will soon rise in
arms to join him.  God bless him, I say, and
confound his enemies!  Long live the Duke of Monmouth!"
</p>

<p>
'Madame's agitation at this juncture became too
much for her.  She sank suddenly into the nearest
seat, and buried her face in her handkerchief.  She
was an excitable person always, Madame St. Aubert;
but never before had she been seen by her pupils
wrought up to such a state of uncontrollable excitement
as this; and never before had our silent, formal
breakfast been enlivened by such a commotion.
There stood all the girls huddled together, surprised,
embarrassed, curious, and some half frightened.
There was my bowl of milk upset, and streaming
quietly over the table-cloth, with Mrs. Fortescue
actually taking not the smallest notice of it; there
was Dr. Power with his wig more crooked than I could
ever have conceived possible if I had not seen it;
and, what seemed stranger to us than anything else,
there was Madame St. Aubert perched on one of our
narrow, long-legged, and most uncomfortable stools,
instead of her own chair of state, and almost tumbling
off, from the vehemence of her hysterical sobs.
</p>

<p>
'"What does it all mean?  Is there going to be a
civil war?" whispered Agnes Blount to Bessie, who
was in far too much of a flutter either to hear or heed.
</p>

<p>
'"But does the King really want to burn us?
Alack! alack!  I will never be made a Papist,"
protested little Lucy Fordyce, her brown eyes round with
horror.
</p>

<p>
'"I wonder if Madame will give us a holiday,"
suggested Camilla Fanshawe with great animation; and
even as she spoke I heard Dr. Power making that
self-same proposal to Madame St. Aubert, who was
beginning to recover a little, the high stool not being a
favourable place for giving way to "attendrissement."
</p>

<p>
'"Yes," she said, after drying her eyes and going
back to her state chair.  Yes, that was just what she
had been about to announce.  Who could be expected
to attend to study after such a piece of news as this?
Therefore she proclaimed a whole holiday, in honour
of the day which, she hoped, we never would forget
to the latest hour of our lives.
</p>

<p>
'"And now I wonder whether these young ladies
know what it is that they are to keep in mind till the
latest day of their lives," said Dr. Power, looking round
upon us with his jovial, good-humoured smile.  "This
little maid, for instance," as his eye fell upon Lucy
Fordyce's beaming face.  "Come hither, child, and
tell us all about it."
</p>

<p>
'But Lucy's ideas upon the subject were evidently
misty in the extreme.  She looked terribly puzzled
and piteous; and I have no doubt that it was only a
strong faith in the promised holiday that kept the
tears out of her eyes.  "Because&mdash;why, because," she
stammered in answer to Dr. Power's question.
</p>

<p>
'"Why does Madame St. Aubert wish you to
remember to-day?" repeated the Doctor.
</p>

<p>
'We are to have a holiday because the Duke of
Monmouth&mdash;&mdash;' and here Lucy came to a dead stop,
being utterly at a loss to know what it was exactly
that the Duke of Monmouth had been doing.
</p>

<p>
'"He came over from Holland on purpose to ask
for a holiday, eh?" said Dr. Power, laughing, and
tapping her under the chin.  "Very good-natured of
his Grace, upon my life!  Well, well, never mind,
sweetheart; but listen to me, and I'll tell you the
reason of his coming over."  Whereupon the good
vicar launched forth into a vigorous little lecture, all
about the Duke of Monmouth, and the great things
that he was going to do for the country.  Such a
hero, according to Dr. Power's description, had never
been known in England since the days of the Black
Prince.  Indeed I began to think again of those
marvellous stories that Shad used to tell of King
Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, and my
admiration for the Duke of Monmouth waxed hotter
than ever.  The Duke (so Dr. Power told us) was a
true and stanch Protestant, and his uncle King
James a bigoted Papist, who would force us all soon
to be Papists too, unless we chose rather to be put
to the torture or burned alive, like those poor souls in
wicked Queen Mary's reign.  From this the Duke
had come to save us.  The King cared only for the
privileges of the Crown, and nought for the rights
of his subjects.  He would make us slaves, and sell
the country to France.  Monmouth was bent solely
upon guarding the liberty of the Parliament and the
people.  Under him we should be, as the Prayer-book
said, "godly and quietly governed;" and every one
would be free to worship in peace as his conscience
taught him.  Moreover, the Duke was the true heir.
He had a better title to the throne than the present
King.  Why, Dr. Power did not wait to explain at
that time.  We should not understand the merits of
the question, he said, even were he to enter into it;
but such, he assured us, was the case.  The Duke's
enemies, with his uncle at their head, had contrived
to banish him six years ago; but now, here he was
back on English ground again, with a loyal band of
followers.  The country was rising in all directions.
In a short time the best part of England would be
with him, the Popish King would be driven from his
throne, and a Protestant prince, loved and honoured
by every true Englishman, would reign in his stead.
</p>

<p>
'So ended Dr. Power's oration, to which we listened
with much respect and awe.  No one, of course,
presumed to question what he said; though I thought
Henrietta looked as if she could have disputed the
truth of some of his remarks had she dared.
Mrs. Fortescue did murmur something about our parents'
political opinions not having been consulted; but she
was summarily quenched by Dr. Power's indignant
"Pshaw! pshaw!  Madame; are we to plant unsound
political faith in young minds for any consideration
whatever?  No, Madame; if the parents of these
children choose to disapprove what Madame St. Aubert
teaches, why, then, let them take away their
daughters from her care."
</p>

<p>
'For my own part, I thought it a matter of course
that Dr. Power's side of the question must be the
right one.  It was enough for me that Madame St. Aubert
and Mrs. Fortescue were on that side, not to
mention my favourite, Bessie; but when Dr. Power,&mdash;the
vicar of our parish, whom we were all in the
habit of holding in the greatest veneration and respect
as a pious and learned divine,&mdash;when he said that the
Duke of Monmouth was right and the King wrong,
it seemed to me that no one ought to have any more
doubt upon the matter.  It gave me a slight shock,
to be sure, to hear his Majesty spoken of in such
terms of disrespect, for mamma had always taught me
that we ought to honour the King; but then
Dr. Power had said that the Duke of Monmouth had
really more right to be king than he, so my mind was
set at ease upon that point.  I had not learned in
those days that even learned and pious men can
sometimes make mistakes, nor that two people may
be equally honest&mdash;equally wise and good&mdash;and yet
see the same thing in a perfectly different light.
</p>

<p>
'The day was a most glorious one.  Never was a
more perfect summer morning.  We were in exuberant
spirits when we poured out into the garden,
to make the most of our holiday, and talk about the
great event which we were to remember to the last
hour of our lives.  I think we all obeyed that
injunction of Madame St. Aubert's to the letter.  I can
answer for three of us at any rate.
</p>

<p>
'"We are absolved from our secret, Frances," said
Bessie.  "Madame St. Aubert called me back to tell
me so, and to bid me give you both her best thanks
for keeping it so well."
</p>

<p>
"She owes me her thanks," said Henrietta, with a
sigh of relief.  "It has been a very painful secret to
me, and I am heartily glad to have done with it."
</p>

<p>
"So that was the reason your face grew so bright
when Dr. Power told us the news!" cried Bessie,
laughing.  "I thought it could not be on the Duke's
account."
</p>

<p>
'"No, indeed.  I was only thinking that, now he
really has landed, the news must soon be known all
over the country.  I have been very uneasy ever
since that promise, Bessie.  I was loth enough to give
it, but I could not refuse to keep a secret that we had
found out in such a questionable, hardly honourable,
kind of way."  Bessie opened her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'"Uneasy!  But why uneasy?  My dear Henrietta,
if you had refused to promise, what difference would
it have made?  What could you have done?"
</p>

<p>
'"I don't quite know, but I felt as if I had no right
to hide such a very serious piece of news as that.
It seemed to me that I ought, in strict right, to let
my father know of it."
</p>

<p>
'"Henrietta!" cried Bessie, aghast.  "But you
could not have done it; Madame would never have
allowed that!"
</p>

<p>
'"No, I do not know that I could have managed it;
but I might have tried.  I fear I did wrong in making
any promise, after all.  Remember, Bessie, this is a
terribly important matter: it is the beginning of a
rebellion&mdash;of a civil war."
</p>

<p>
'"But, Henrietta," I asked, "won't your father
join the Duke of Monmouth, then?  Bessie says she
is sure her uncle will.  Oh, how I hope my father
will, too!  And, ah! poor Oliver, I know how he will
long to be off to the Duke's army, and how he will
try to persuade mamma that he is old enough."  Henrietta
smiled, and pulled my curls.
</p>

<p>
'"No, Francis, I hope your father will do no such
thing; and I am quite sure that mine will not.
However, happen what may now, my father, and the King,
and everybody else too, knows what is going on, and
can take whatever course they please; so I am content.
I can do neither good nor harm in the matter now."
</p>

<p>
'"No," sighed Bessie: "if we were only men!
But, as it is, we can do nothing to help the Duke,
nothing whatever, except to pray that the right side
may have the victory."
</p>

<p>
'"The right side," murmured Henrietta thoughtfully.
"Yes, Bessie, we can pray for the right side."
</p>

<p>
'Now that our tongues were free once more, Bessie
and I were ready enough to astonish the other girls
with the history of our adventure three days ago;
and great was the excitement and interest with which
they listened to it.
</p>

<p>
'"<i>I</i> knew there was something!"  "So that was
why you all three vanished for such a long time?"
"<i>I</i> thought Bessie squeezed up her lips unusually
tight, as if she was afraid something was going to
escape them."  "<i>I</i> wondered why Frances had been
looking so solemn and important lately."  Such were
the exclamations with which our story was
greeted,&mdash;exclamations that rather hurt my feelings, and
Bessie's too, I think, for we had prided ourselves
upon behaving exactly the same as usual, and not
looking in the least bit conscious or mysterious.
</p>

<p>
'"I wonder what your father will do, Frances,"
said Agnes Blount, "and Sir Harry, and poor Algernon
too.  Why, what will become of the pages if the
King and Queen are driven away?  Alack! alack!  I
hope he won't be beheaded, or anything dreadful
happen to him!"  This startling idea had not struck
me before.  Poor Algernon! of course I should not
have liked him to be beheaded; though, at the same
time, it was a great comfort to think that it was he,
and not Oliver, whose neck might be in danger.
</p>

<p>
'"Nonsense, Agnes," I said, trying to speak very
decidedly.  "As if they would behead a boy!"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, but they would," put in Lucy Fordyce.
"Prince Arthur was only a boy, you know, and yet
King John murdered him."
</p>

<p>
'"My dear Lucy, that was so very long ago.
Besides Lord Desmond is not heir to the Crown."  There
was something in that argument, as Agnes
allowed, still she did not seem quite satisfied.
</p>

<p>
'"No, but you see, Frances, he is one of the Queen's
pages; and if there really is going to be another civil
war, perhaps they will murder the King, as they did
his father, and maybe the Queen too; and then, of
course, any one belonging to the court will be in great
danger.  Oh Fan, supposing poor Algernon was to be
killed, you would be a widow, you know.  Oh dear! oh
dear!  How shocking!"  This last recollection,
added to her fears for Algernon, was too much for
Agnes.  She gave one half-stifled sob and burst into
tears.
</p>

<p>
'This made me feel very uncomfortable, and more
really frightened on Algernon's account than I had
been at first; for it was such a new thing to see Agnes
cry&mdash;Agnes, generally so blyth and sweet-tempered&mdash;that
I began to fear that things must indeed be
getting serious.  Poor Algernon!  We had not been
particularly good friends that first and last time of our
meeting, considering for what purpose that meeting
had been, nor had our parting been much taken to
heart by either of us; yet when I remembered his
honest brown eyes, and round, rosy, good-humoured
face as he rushed about so happily with my brothers,
and then tried to imagine him with his curly head
upon the block, or dying, sword in hand, amongst a
heap of slaughtered pages, a sudden desire came over
me to cry also.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy <i>you</i> a widow!" repeated Agnes, with
another dismal sob, as I put my arm round her neck
and tried to say something consoling.
</p>

<p>
'"Like Dr. Power's mother," suggested Lucy
Fordyce, looking at me with a sort of scared expression.
</p>

<p>
'I made an effort to fancy myself like Dr. Power's
mother, and the consequence was a violent fit of
laughter, which checked my tears completely, and
dried up Agnes's too; for Mistress Tabitha Power
was eighty-five, and wore deep mourning robes which
swept the ground, a black hood drawn almost over
her face, and always leaned upon an ebony crutch
with a silver handle.  Then, when our laugh was over,
Agnes began to wonder again what side my father
and Sir Harry Mountfort would take in the coming
war, if war there really was to be.  Mamma, I felt
pretty sure, would be for the Duke of Monmouth,
because Dr. Power had said that the King would
make Papists of us all; and I knew that mamma was
the stanchest of Protestants, and that nothing on
earth would be so abhorrent to her as the idea of
having her own religion or that of her children
interfered with.  As to my father, I did not know what to
think about him, but I had a vague impression that
Colonel Dare thought him likely to favour the Duke's
pretensions; and if Colonel Dare did not know, who
did?  Agnes was rather doubtful about Sir Harry.  She
wished very much to believe that he would take the
same view of affairs as Madame St. Aubert and Dr. Power,
but could not avoid a misgiving that, whatever
his own opinions might be, the part which he
eventually took would be decided by Lady Mountfort.
</p>

<p>
'"And she is a strict Catholic, you know, Frances;
and no ones loves the King more than she does.  I
remember how she used to praise him when he was
Duke of York.  Ah! she will never let Sir Harry
stand up against King James, and he always does
everything she wishes."
</p>

<p>
'"Perhaps my father will persuade him," I suggested:
"they are such great friends, you know."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! you don't know Lady Mountfort," returned
Agnes despondingly.  She was quite a Monmouthite
already, the only drawback being her uneasiness for
Algernon.  In fact Dr. Power's eloquence had plunged
every one of us (Henrietta alone excepted) heart and
soul into the Duke's cause, which was not to be
wondered at.  What else, indeed, was to be expected,
considering how very little we knew about the business,
save what he chose to tell us?  So we sat under the
lime tree all that pleasant sunny morning, making
guesses as to what our respective relations intended
to do; and trying to persuade ourselves that they,
one and all, must, should, and would buckle on their
swords for our hero, the Duke of Monmouth.
</p>

<p>
'Madame invited us to sup with her that evening
in the north parlour; and a few of her particular
friends were of the party&mdash;Dr. Power amongst them,
who was in tremendous spirits, and made another
speech, so brilliant that I thought it might almost
have brought King James himself to come quietly
down from his throne and make a present of his crown
to his nephew.  Yes, that was a delightful evening.
We danced, and sang madrigals, and played games,
and, before we broke up, drank Monmouth's health
in a cup of that very choice canary which was
generally considered sacred to Dr. Power, and which
Madame's pupils had never aspired to partake of in
their wildest dreams.
</p>

<p>
'Well, the time passed on, and little was talked of
in the house but the Duke of Monmouth and his
prospects.  Scraps of news came in from time to time
to feed our excitement, the bearer thereof being
generally Dr. Power.  First we heard of a skirmish at
Bridport, which seemed to have been a somewhat
confused and doubtful affair, in which neither side
had got much the best of it.  Then we were shocked
by hearing that Colonel Dare was dead, shot in a
quarrel with a Scotch gentleman, one of Monmouth's
followers.  Dr. Power shook his head very gravely
when he told us this.  It looked ill, he said, for the
discipline of the Duke's army and the unity of his
officers, that such an outrage should have taken place.
However, the Duke had been highly indignant, and
had done the only thing that could be done under the
circumstances, and sent off the offending Scot, Colonel
Fletcher of Saltoun, to the Continent.
</p>

<p>
'"So there go two of his best officers already,"
quoth Dr. Power, with a sigh; "and that's no trifling
loss, let me tell you.  Ah! well, I always told Dare
it would come to this.  I have known him from a
boy, and he was always the same furious, hot-headed
fellow.  Ah-h-h," and Dr. Power went away, whistling
to be sure, as usual, but the air he whistled was
slow and plaintive, and his face a shade less cheerful
than it was wont to be.  But the next time he made
his appearance he was brisk and light-hearted as
ever; and well he might be, considering what tidings
he brought.  Four thousand men of the train-bands,
under the Duke of Albemarle, had been arrayed near
Axminster, and were preparing to meet the
invaders; but no sooner did Monmouth's troops appear
upon the scene than the train-bands retreated in
confusion, without waiting to strike a blow, and the
Duke&mdash;<i>our</i> Duke&mdash;was marching in triumph towards
Taunton.  It was Dr. Power's opinion that we might
expect to see him that very evening.  You may fancy
the effect of this announcement upon Madame
St. Aubert's household.  The delight and excitement
that reigned there were quite indescribable.  Even
the scullions in the kitchen were heard uttering
distant hurrahs.
</p>

<p>
'The rest of the day was spent in bustle and
preparation.  The garden was stripped of all its gayest
and choicest flowers, and the usual books, slates, and
ink-stands which generally filled the schoolroom gave
way to bright heaps of roses, lilies, pansies, and
carnations, which were to be turned into wreaths and
garlands before the evening.  Ah, how well I remember
that day!&mdash;the laughter and chatter as we worked
at the wreaths, and the breathless interest with which
we watched them put up afterwards in festoons, over
door, balcony, and windows.  All the gardens in
Taunton must have been plundered, I think, that
morning, for, as we looked down the street, every
house seemed, like our own, to be absolutely glowing
with flowers.
</p>

<p>
'It was nearly sunset when the sound of drum and
fife, the ring of steel, and the even tramp of many
feet announced that Monmouth and his army must
be at hand; and never shall I forget the storm of
cheers that welcomed him as he came riding into
the town.  It seemed to rise from every street in
Taunton; and I suppose it was that I had never
heard so many voices together before, but the sound
gave me a curious, uncomfortable, half-frightened
feeling, as if I must get out of everybody's sight, and
cry.  However, this was quite out of the question;
the balcony where we stood being so much crowded,
that it was a hard matter to move one's arms enough
to throw down the pinks and roses with which our
aprons were filled.  The street was thickly lined on
each side with people in holiday dress, and all
carrying green boughs; and from every window and
balcony handkerchiefs and scarves were waving, and
flowers were raining down.  The Duke looked up
and bowed as he passed underneath our windows
whereupon Madame St. Aubert gasped out, "O mon
roi! mon roi!" and burst into one of her floods of
tears; while Bessie, in the violence of her feeling,
flung away handkerchief and basket as well as her
flowers, and was heard afterwards anxiously questioning
every one as to what could possibly have become
of them.  "Was I not right, Frances?  Is he not a
noble, gallant prince?  Does he not look like a
king?" demanded she triumphantly, when the Duke
and his white horse could no longer be distinguished.
And to this I agreed, with all my heart; as well I
might, considering how many older and wiser folks
than I had been completely carried away by
Monmouth's handsome face and graceful winning manner.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh Henrietta, if you would only have come
out to see him, you would have changed your mind!"  Such
was the assurance that all the girls repeated
over and over again, when Henrietta was hearing a
detailed account of the procession from beginning to
end; for she had steadily refused to help in the
making of the wreaths or to join the party on the
balcony, and Madame was far too much pre-occupied
to care whether she came or stayed away.  A shrug
of the shoulders, and a contemptuous "stiff-necked
little fool!" was her only attempt at remonstrance.
So Henrietta quietly managed to keep out of the way
all the afternoon; and when the last man in the
procession had passed out of the street, we ran off to
find her, and pour out a description of the great sight
we had seen, to the only person in the house who had
not been a witness of it.  She was as much interested,
and asked as many questions as we could wish;
but all our regrets that she had missed the pageant,
and all our protestations that she must have changed
her mind had she seen the Duke of Monmouth, only
made her smile and shake her head.
</p>

<p>
'"Indeed, Bessie," she said, "I quite believe that
he is as handsome and brave and gallant a gentleman
as you say, but that is no proof against what my father
told me; and now I know that, I hope that merely
to look upon him would not make me change my
mind.  I suppose a comely face and gentle bearing
are not enough to give him a right to the throne, nor
to make him a good king, or a good soldier either."
</p>

<p>
'There was no denying this; nevertheless it made
not the slightest impression upon any of us.  Madame
St. Aubert and Dr. Power believed in the Duke
of Monmouth, and we were content to follow their
lead.  He was our hero, for whom we vowed that
we would willingly have laid down our lives, and, at
the time, we really fancied that we meant what we
said.  Next morning, though the flowers had vanished
from the schoolroom, books and desks were not yet
to be seen in their stead.  To-day the first thing that
met our eyes as we entered the room was a piece of
sky-blue silk spread out upon the middle of the table,
and surrounded by innumerable skeins of gold and
silver thread, and silks in all the colours of the
rainbow.  These, Madame told us, were the materials for
a banner to be presented to the Duke before his
departure from Taunton&mdash;"presented by us, our very
own selves," as Lucy Fordyce said, clapping her hands
with delight.
</p>

<p>
'"Whoever has a hand in the making of it shall
walk in the procession," said Madame, with a smile,
as she drew the heap of silks towards her and began
to disentangle the skeins.
</p>

<p>
'We were all feeling rather dull after the intense
excitement of the day before, and the working of the
banner seemed to be the very thing we felt most
inclined to do,&mdash;something that could really be done
for the Duke,&mdash;something that, by our efforts, we
might make not unworthy to be offered.  These
thoughts were enough to revive all our enthusiasm,
and to set us to work with an energy and perseverance
which, I am afraid, we had never been known before
to display in Madame St. Aubert's schoolroom.
Pauline proceeded to draw out the pattern, Bessie to
sort the silks into heaps of the same colour, but
varying in shade; and the little ones were soon busy in
winding skeins and threading needles for the whole
party.  To my own great joy, I was not classed
among the "little ones" on the present occasion.
Mamma had taught me to embroider very well; and,
much as I hated it at home, I was glad to find, when
I came to school, that there was one thing at least
which I could do better than Agnes Blount,&mdash;better,
indeed, than most of the girls much older than myself.
Henrietta was the only one whom I could not hope to
rival; and Henrietta would not help us.  We dragged
her into the room, and made her admire the soft rich
blue of the silk, and the glittering gold and silver, with
which it was to be ornamented, and from habit she
began to show Mary Seymour how to hold her hand
so as not to soil her work; but when she glanced over
Pauline's shoulder and saw the pattern that she was
copying, she exclaimed, "Oh Pauline!" in a voice of
such disapproval and distress that we all looked up
surprised.
</p>

<p>
'"Don't you think a lion and a unicorn will be
pretty, Henrietta?" I asked anxiously.  "I wanted
to have some beautiful gold lilies, like those in that
French book Madame showed us; but Bessie said
that would not do, because the Duke of Monmouth
must have the arms of England."
</p>

<p>
'"But he is to have a French motto," observed
Lucy Fordyce.  "And such an easy one.  I can
translate it quite well: 'God and my Right.'  It is all
to be written in gold letters.  Don't you think it will
look very well?"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh yes, very well indeed," replied Henrietta,
with a little smile that seemed to make Bessie quite
angry, for she said indignantly;
</p>

<p>
'"Well, Henrietta, and has he not the best right in
the world to the royal arms?  Is he not our king
already?"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, certainly, if wearing our king's colours makes
him so; and I think he ought to be proud of having
such a devoted subject.  But, Bessie dear, I see you
have changed your favourite rose colour for blue,
which I have often heard you say does not suit you
half so well."
</p>

<p>
'Bessie looked vexed at this speech, and her cheeks
flushed for a minute; but then, glancing down at her
blue breast-knot with a proud smile, she said enthusiastically,
almost defiantly, "I don't care if you do laugh
at me.  It is the only thing I can do for him."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! that is right!  That is my own warm-hearted
Bessie," cried Pauline, who always expressed
her feelings far more openly and strongly than any of the
rest of us.  "I think it is very right and noble of her to
do it, and I would do just the same&mdash;only, unfortunately,
blue does suit me; so it is no sacrifice."  And
darting an indignant look at Henrietta, she flew to
Bessie's side and bestowed an affectionate kiss on
both her cheeks.  Pauline's demonstrative ways used
to make us all feel rather embarrassed sometimes;
and Henrietta especially would become colder and
more reserved than ever when Pauline was "attendrie"
or "emue," as she expressed it.  On the present
occasion, however, her eyes twinkled with fun when
she saw that Pauline's hasty movement had swept our
beautiful banner down to the floor, while all the
embroiderers had stopped their work to stare at Bessie,
and did not even make an effort to save it.
</p>

<p>
'"Well, good-bye, Pauline," she said, turning to
leave the room; "I won't hinder your work any
longer.  Your hero's standard is trailing in the dust,
which is rather a bad omen; but it was not I that
threw it there."  And Henrietta vanished, while the
rest of the party returned to their work with increased
soberness and diligence, but rather less talking than
before.
</p>

<p>
We prospered very well after we had begun: we
were all anxious to show Henrietta what we could
accomplish, even without her skilful fingers to aid us.
Moreover, Madame St. Aubert came to superintend;
and, after a time, when lion and unicorn were beginning
to stand forth in all their bravery from their gay
background, carefully balancing a glistening crown
between their uplifted fore-paws, she brought in
Dr. Power to see and admire.  He praised our needlework
to our hearts' content; but when he put on his
spectacles to examine the device, he looked almost as
grave as Henrietta had done, and gave a sort of
subdued whistle of surprise.  But Madame St. Aubert
whispered something in his ear which caused him to
say, "Ah! well, I thought it would come to that; but
'tis a pity&mdash;in my opinion 'tis a thousand pities&mdash;that
the Duke should allow such a decided step to be
taken."
</p>

<p>
'Madame St. Aubert drew herself up as stiffly as if
she was going to hear Dr. Power the multiplication-table.
"I have the best authority for saying that
the measure was recommended by his Grace's most
trusted advisers," replied she with dignity.
</p>

<p>
'Dr. Power looked as puzzled as though he had
forgotten that twice one made two, and rubbed his wig
till it was quite crooked, before he said, with an air
of relief, "Well, Madame, the Scripture hath declared
that in the multitude of counsellors there is safety;
and so, I hope, it will prove on the present occasion.
For myself, I shall certainly be able to say with all
my heart, 'God save our King.'"
</p>

<p>
'I did not in the least understand what was meant
by this conversation; and when I pulled Bessie's
sleeve and asked her, she said she was not quite sure,
and I must wait till to-morrow to know.
</p>

<p>
'I was not much wiser when the morrow came, and
Bessie told me, with a beaming face, that the Duke
of Monmouth was going to be proclaimed king in the
market-place of Taunton.  However, seeing that she
looked very glad, I tried to feel glad too, and
succeeded completely, when she informed me that, after
the proclamation had taken place, our banner was to
be presented by the whole school in procession, as
the gift of the maids of Taunton.
</p>

<p>
'"And when&mdash;when is it to be, Bessie?" cried
several voices.
</p>

<p>
'"Next Thursday, Madame says; so we have not
too much time; but I'll work my fingers to the bone
rather than it should not be done."
</p>

<p>
'We were all of the same mind about this; and
work we did, with an energy that astonished even
Madame St. Aubert, and that wore holes in some of
our thimbles, even if our fingers escaped safe and
sound.  But were we not repaid for all our trouble on
the morning, when Bessie, the leader of a long
procession, stood by the market-cross, holding in her
hand the staff from which floated our completed
banner in all its beauty, just fluttering enough in the
wind to show gleams of the red and gold, forming the
scroll and tracery which adorned its ample folds?
What a crowd filled the market-place! and however
one pushed and struggled to catch a glimpse of Bessie,
whose bright eyes were brighter than usual, and whose
colour came and went every moment with excitement!
"How pretty Bessie is!" I whispered to
Agnes; "I never knew she was pretty till to-day."  "Hush!
Hush! the Duke is coming," was all Agnes
had time to say, before such a cheer rang through the
market-place as I never heard in my life before.  It
quite drowned the clatter of hoofs, as the Duke of
Monmouth and his train came riding through the
throng of people, the Duke smiling and bowing to
every one as he passed, and having to take off his hat
so often, that at last he kept it in his hand, and rode
on, bare-headed, up to the market-cross, where he
alighted, and, standing on the steps, bowed once more,
while the cheers rose higher and higher.  And now I
thought the important time had come; but Bessie
knew better, and waited while one of the Duke's
followers, very richly dressed, blew a loud blast on a
trumpet&mdash;to secure silence, I suppose&mdash;and then read
in a high, monotonous voice, from a strip of parchment
which he held in his hand, a proclamation, of
which I could not catch one word.  It was only by
standing on tip-toe that I could see what was going
on; and it was by keeping in this position, and
holding fast by Agnes Blount's arm, that I saw how,
when the gentleman had finished reading, he waved
his hat in the air and shouted "God save the King!"
with all his might.  It must have been every voice in
Taunton, I think, which joined the answering shout
of "God save the King!  Long live Monmouth, the
true heir to the throne!  The Protestant succession
for ever!  Down with the Papists!"  I dropped back
into my former position, and left my hold on Agnes's
shoulder, not quite certain whether I felt most inclined
to clap my hands and cheer as Dr. Power was doing,
or to stop my ears and sob hysterically, like little
Lucy Fordyce, who was quite scared at the noise.
</p>

<p>
'"Hush, hush, Lucy! don't cry, chérie," whispered
Pauline consolingly.  "There, it is all over now,
Look at mamma: the Duke is going to speak to her.
Oh, mon Dieu, what a handsome man! what fire in
the eyes!" and Pauline, after good-naturedly putting
Lucy into a place where she could see what was going
on, relapsed into silence, only occasionally broken by
murmured exclamations in French, when her feelings
became too much for her.
</p>

<p>
'Madame St. Aubert knelt on one knee before the
Duke, kissed his hand, and presented him with a
Bible, splendidly bound in crimson and gold.
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! qu'il a l'air noble et gracieux!  C'est un
vrai roi!" cried Pauline below her breath, as the Duke
took her mother's hand to raise her from the ground,
bowed profoundly over it, and said as he took the gift
she offered: "Madame, I have come to defend the
truths contained in this book, and to seal them, if so
it must be, with my blood."
</p>

<p>
'I heard these words quite distinctly, in the sudden
silence which had followed the cheers; but, after the
Duke had finished speaking, the noise grew more
deafening than ever.  A great many people were
sobbing, too, besides Lucy Fordyce, though it could
not have been with fright, like her, for they were quite
grown-up.
</p>

<p>
'Dr. Power rubbed his hands together and said,
"Right, right: those are the best words that have
been spoken yet," quite out loud.  And Eleanor Page
whispered to Pauline, "I wish Henrietta was here:
she would be convinced now."
</p>

<p>
'And now, at a sign from Madame St. Aubert, the
whole school began to move forward, and we all fell
into our proper places in the procession.  Bessie did
not change colour now, nor falter in the least, as she
knelt before the Duke and gave the banner into his
hand, with the few words which had been arranged
beforehand for her to say: "Will your Grace deign to
accept all we have to offer you&mdash;the best work of our
hands, with the best wishes of our hearts?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">

<br>
BESSIE DID NOT CHANGE COLOUR NOW, NOR FALTER IN THE <br>
LEAST, AS SHE KNELT BEFORE THE DUKE AND GAVE THE <br>
BANNER INTO HIS HANDS.
</p>

<p>
'"When you see these colours again, fair mistress,"
said the Duke, as he clasped the staff in his hand,
"I trust they will have waved over a conquered field.
We cannot but be victorious who fight under a flag
worked by so many fair hands, and accompanied by
the wishes of so many kind hearts.  In the name of
my followers as well as my own, I thank you, and all
people of the good town of Taunton, for their faith in
me and in my cause.  I ask them to keep their faith
only a little longer, and it shall be justified.  We are
in arms for the liberties of England, and for the
Protestant religion, and therefore can say, without the
shadow of a doubt or scruple, 'May God defend the
right!'"
</p>

<p>
'Bessie's earnest "Amen" was repeated in a sort of
shout by many voices, for the Duke spoke in tones
clear enough to be heard by all around him.
Dr. Power was just going to rub his hands again, but
changed his mind, and rubbed one eye instead&mdash;very
hard indeed&mdash;and then looked about him with such a
triumphant smile, that I felt exactly as if he was
saying, "I told you so.  Did I not use almost these
very words, young ladies?  Let this be impressed
upon your minds till the latest hour of your
lives."  Certainly the impression was made upon mine.
I can recollect even now all that happened on that
day, down to the most trivial particulars, with a
minuteness that would satisfy even Dr. Power himself.
But, anxious as he was that it should be so, I am
quite sure that he never dreamed what terrible reason
we should all have for remembering that twentieth of
June to the latest hour of our lives.

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br><br>
THE MAIDS OF TAUNTON (CONTINUED).
</h3>

<p>
The next day we watched the Duke of
Monmouth's troops march out of Taunton
on their way to Bridgewater.  File after
file of soldiers passed under our eyes, and
yet there were more behind.
</p>

<p>
'"Thousands and thousands of them!" Camilla
Fanshawe said, with a look of awe.  "How can anybody
doubt that the Duke will get back his rights,
and win the crown which belonged to him, with such
an army as that to fight his battles?"
</p>

<p>
'And yet we all agreed that its leader looked very
melancholy.  Though "Long live King Monmouth!"
was echoing all down the street as he passed, he did
not smile, but merely bowed mechanically, without
caring to glance up at the faces which filled every
window and balcony on both sides of the way.
</p>

<p>
'"Why does he look like that?" said Camilla, quite
disappointed, like the rest of us, at the change which
had come over the Duke since yesterday.
</p>

<p>
'"Perhaps he is sorry to leave Taunton," suggested
Agnes.  "You know every one seems to like him so
much here, and maybe they will not in other places."
</p>

<p>
'"Perhaps he is thinking how many of the men
who are marching with him now may never come
back to Taunton," said Eleanor Page gravely.
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta sighed, and turned away from the
window; and though the rest of us stayed there till
the last strain of music died away in the distance, and
the last straggler of the rabble who followed the army
had vanished from our sight, yet it was with very
sober faces that we gazed, for this was the first time
that we really began to think what must be some of
the consequences of the scene we had witnessed
yesterday.
</p>

<p>
'"Will they fight a battle, and all be killed?" asked
Lucy Fordyce anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Nobody answered.  But I am sure that we were
all thinking the same thing, and were wondering how
long it would be before we should hear news of the
men who had just marched away from before our eyes,
leaving the streets of Taunton to look duller and
emptier than they had ever done before.
</p>

<p>
'We did not hear anything at all for about a week,
and then only that the Duke had been well received
at Bridgewater&mdash;that he had marched from there to
Glastonbury, Wells, Bristol, and other places whose
names I forgot as soon as I heard them.  After this,
reports became extremely vague.  "The Duke was
marching straight for London," we were told, "with the
King's army flying before him;" but this was
immediately contradicted by some one who knew (on the
best authority) that the Duke was making his
way through Worcestershire towards Shropshire and
Cheshire, in order to collect his friends in those
counties; after which we heard that he had won a
decisive victory at Philips Norton, and then that there
had been no battle at all there.  By the time the
great news really came, which brought back all our
excitement and interest in a rush, most of the younger
girls, and certainly myself among the number, were
getting very tired of the perpetual discussions about
the Duke and his prospects which went on among our
elders.
</p>

<p>
'"We cannot do anything; so what is the use of
talking about it?" Camilla said.  And I secretly
agreed with her, though my affection for Bessie
generally kept me at her side during play-hours, in
spite of the fact that she talked of nothing but this
one subject, which was becoming, to my mind, a very
stale one indeed.
</p>

<p>
'One morning I was standing by the window in
our bedroom doing nothing, though I had been sent
there to learn a lesson, given me as a punishment for
inattention.  I looked at my book for about five
minutes, and then relapsed into a day-dream about
Oliver and Hebe, which was broken by my hearing a
noise in the street.  Of course I went to the window
to see what it meant, and to my astonishment beheld
quite a crowd collected in front of our house,&mdash;among
them Madame St. Aubert herself, whom I had left a
quarter of an hour ago in the schoolroom reading
aloud a book of French history to the elder girls.
She was talking very fast and eagerly, and once wrung
her hands with a sort of impatient despair, which
convinced me that something dreadful was the matter.
What could have happened?  I was just thinking of
venturing down-stairs, at the risk of a scolding, when
I heard footsteps hurriedly approaching, and Bessie,
looking white and terrified, entered the room.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, Frances!" she cried as I sprang towards her.
"Such news!&mdash;such miserable news!  All is over
with the cause now.  There is nothing more to hope
for."  And Bessie sank into a chair and burst into a
flood of tears.
</p>

<p>
'"But how do you know?  What has happened?
Has there been a battle?  Is the Duke of Monmouth
killed?"  All these questions I hurried out at once,
standing bewildered in the middle of the floor, staring
at Bessie, who at last raised her head and went on
with her story.
</p>

<p>
'"Job Tallis has come back."  (Job Tallis was
Madame St. Aubert's gardener, and was one of the
many young men who had joined the Duke's standard
while he was at Taunton.)  "There has been a
dreadful battle at a place called Sedgemoor, close to
Bridgewater.  The Duke's men fought like lions, Job
says; but it was all of no use.  They were
outnumbered&mdash;their ammunition failed them&mdash;their cavalry
were scattered by the first shot: that must have been
Lord Grey's fault."  And Bessie stopped to give a
little stamp with her foot, and to wipe her eyes, as she
said this: "Oh, if I was but a man?  But there, that
is nonsense.  It was at night, and there was such a
fog that it was impossible to see a dozen yards in
front of you.  They fought till after daybreak,&mdash;till
Feversham's artillery broke their ranks to pieces&mdash;till
they were literally ridden down by his cavalry."
</p>

<p>
'"And the Duke?" I asked, beginning to tremble,
for Bessie's excitement was infectious.  She shook
her head.
</p>

<p>
'"Job knows nothing about him.  He saw him last
on foot, encouraging his men, and was close to him
for a little while; but he was struck down by a pike
(Job, I mean), and knew nothing more till the fight
was over, and then he was almost taken prisoner,
Oh! he has had a great many escapes and
adventures; but I could not stay to hear about them,
I wanted to come up here out of everybody's way."
</p>

<p>
'"But, Bessie, I don't understand what will become
of the Duke if he is alive.  Will he collect a great
many more men and fight another battle?  And if he
is taken prisoner, what will they do to him?  Will
they&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Don't, Frances," and Bessie covered her face with
her hands and shuddered.  "I don't know anything.
It is too horrible to think about.  Oh, he must escape!
Perhaps he is in hiding somewhere; perhaps he has
reached a seaport already, and is safe on board ship."
</p>

<p>
'I could not get much more from Bessie, who
presently begged me to leave her alone; so I stole
down-stairs and joined the rest of the household, who
were every one of them assembled in the kitchen
listening to Job Tallis's account of his own exploits,
and of the utter ruin which had overtaken the Duke's
forces, in spite of the valour of his army in general,
and of the men of Taunton in particular.  Nor was
his the only evidence we had of the fight.  Fugitives
kept coming into the town, one after another, all that
afternoon, and they all told the same story.  Only, of
the Duke nothing certain was known, except that he
had not fallen upon the field of battle.  Ah! well.
We heard quite soon enough.  From that day began
a time when every morning brought us in bad
news,&mdash;dreadful stories of the sufferings of the wounded
men, or of the cruelties practised on their prisoners
by the victorious soldiers.
</p>

<p>
'People were not so particular then as they are
now about keeping children away from all that is
shocking or horrible; and I remember standing,
open-mouthed, listening to stories repeated by the servants,
the elder girls, ay, and by Madame St. Aubert herself,&mdash;stories
of such atrocities as it would make you ill to
think about, and which I would not relate to you for
the world.  To be sure, it would not have been of
much use keeping us in ignorance of what was going
on, for in a few days' time Taunton itself was the
scene of some of the worst horrors,&mdash;horrors so
appalling that even the Duke of Monmouth's fate,
when we came to hear of it, only gave us a momentary
shock of pity and regret.  You have read all about it
in your books of history: you know that the Duke of
Monmouth was "convicted of high treason, and
executed on Tower Hill, in the thirty-seventh year of his
age;" and that "those concerned in his rebellion were
tried and sentenced by Judge Jeffreys, noted for
severity in the execution of his office;" but you just
think of it as something which takes up half a page
of Mangnall's Questions, which must be learnt and said
in a given time.  You do not realize&mdash;how should
you?&mdash;what it was to live in the midst of these things
as I did&mdash;to have the events which make up the
history of the time happening outside your very door&mdash;to
be obliged even to take a part in them yourself.
But I must go on with my story more regularly, or I
shall never be able to make you understand the order
in which everything took place.
</p>

<p>
'After hearing all the particulars which could be
gleaned of the fight at Sedgemoor, of course we were
wild to know something about the leaders of the
thousand men who lay dead on the field of battle.
Bessie, especially, was so eager about it, that she would
run out into the street to question every fresh arrival
from Bridgewater&mdash;whether it were a group of
worn-out runaways, or a body of King James's soldiers
in pursuit of the same.  She got her news at last, and
came in, crying, to tell us how Lord Grey had been
captured on the border of the New Forest, disguised
as a peasant; and how the Duke had been found soon
after, hidden under some fern and brambles, famished
with hunger, and so altered that he could hardly be
recognised.
</p>

<p>
'"And who told you all this?" inquired Madame
St. Aubert, who had been much shut up in her own
room of late with Mrs. Fortescue, and was not aware
of Bessie's little expeditions in search of information.
</p>

<p>
'"It was one of Colonel Kirke's officers, Madame,"
said Bessie, who knew she had been doing what was
entirely contrary to all known rules; but who trusted
to the "bouleversement" of Madame's ideas, and to
the general disorder which prevailed in the school just
then, to save herself from the scolding which she
knew she richly deserved.
</p>

<p>
'"And pray, Mademoiselle Bessie, what business
had you to be talking to Colonel Kirke's officers?"
demanded Madame in her most freezing tone.
</p>

<p>
'"I would not have done it at any other time,
indeed, Madame, but I was so anxious to hear some
news of our poor Duke.  The gentleman was very
civil, and answered all my questions; but I did not
like him much, though he asked me where I lived,
and said he should do himself the honour of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'But Bessie was not allowed to finish her sentence,
for Madame St. Aubert advanced a step or two, gave
her a sound box on the ear, and then, to our great
surprise, sank back in a chair and went into hysterics.
Her "bouleversement" of ideas had taken a different
turn from what we expected.  Not that the box on
the ear astonished us so very much.  Madame had
been known to bestow the like before, under circumstances
of great provocation,&mdash;but that she should go
into hysterics afterwards, this was remarkable indeed;
and we stood looking at her in awe-struck silence till
she recovered enough to speak.  I suppose the knowledge
that so many pairs of eyes were upon her, helped
to restore her composure.  At any rate, it was not long
before she rose from her seat with great dignity
(Madame always was particularly dignified after
losing her temper), and requested Bessie to follow her
out of the room.  "As for you, young ladies," she
said, turning round upon us as she reached the door,
"let me beg that there may be no more of this
unseemly curiosity about what does not concern you.
You will hear quite enough about the Duke, without
babbling about his affairs to everybody.  Do you
hear?  From this day forth I forbid his name to be
mentioned in my house, under pain of my severe
displeasure."  With these words Madame sailed out of
the room, and remained invisible for the rest of the
day.
</p>

<p>
'She left, however, a very rebellious set of pupils
behind her.  It was not so easy to stop all interest
in our hero as it had been to arouse our enthusiasm
for him.  Many were the murmurs we indulged in,
and the hard names we called Madame St. Aubert
for being "so mean-spirited as to desert the Duke in
the hour of his misfortune."
</p>

<p>
'This phrase was Bessie's, and we all admired it
extremely.  She came back from her private interview
in a state of wrathful indignation, in which we
all shared.  "Madame St. Aubert," she said, "was a
coward; and, now that the Duke of Monmouth's
cause was lost, wanted to turn against him like the
rest of the world, and to deny that she had ever
befriended him.  As if the Government would dream
of meddling with her for what she had done!  The
Government had other things to think of.  Don't you
think so, Henrietta?" she concluded with a sudden
change of voice, as if Madame St. Aubert had
succeeded in frightening her a little in spite of her high
tone.
</p>

<p>
'"I don't know about that," said Henrietta in her
slow, considering way.  "At any rate, it is as well to
be prudent, Bess, or you might be getting other
people into trouble without doing the Duke of
Monmouth any good.  You remember what we saw
yesterday?"
</p>

<p>
'There was a moment's silence, as we remembered
with a pang the wretched faces of a long line of
prisoners, chained two and two, whom we had seen
marching into Taunton between files of Colonel
Kirke's soldiers.  Colonel Kirke was in command of
King James's troops now, since General Feversham
had been sent for to London, and had entered
Taunton with a large body of men the day before.
</p>

<p>
'"But, Henrietta," said Eleanor Page in rather a
tremulous voice, "that was quite different: those
poor men had been fighting for the Duke, and they
were taken prisoners on the field of battle.  Madame
can't be afraid of anything of that sort happening to
her."
</p>

<p>
'"Of course not," said Mary Seymour lightly;
"Henrietta is such a croaker.  For my part, I
thought she would be delighted to hear of the Duke's
misfortunes; she was always talking against him
when he was here."
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta flushed up at this, and was just opening
her mouth to answer, when Ph[oe]be Morris, one of the
servant girls, rushed into the room, wringing her
hands, crying and sobbing, in such a state of
distraction that we could hardly make out what she
said.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh Mistress Henrietta!  Oh young ladies, where
is Madame?  Oh! get her to come and speak a word
for him.  Oh my poor Job Tallis: they've taken him
away between them&mdash;two of those wicked soldiers;
and he'll be hanged&mdash;I know he will; and all because
they found his pike behind the kitchen door, with the
blue ribbons on it I tied there a fortnight ago.  Oh,
what a fool I was not to hide it under the faggot
stack when he brought it home!"
</p>

<p>
'"Hanged, Ph[oe]be! he can't surely be hanged for
following the Duke.  Why, they must hang every
man in Taunton if they hang him: they all did the
same thing.  And that is impossible."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, but they will, Mistress Bessie," persisted
Ph[oe]be.  "That Colonel Kirke is a wicked, wicked
man.  They have got a gallows in front of the White
Hart Inn, and there were three strapping young
fellows hung there this morning.  You can see it if
you like to come up-stairs to my bedroom window."
</p>

<p>
'But none of us took advantage of this offer, and
Ph[oe]be, with her apron at her eyes, went away to tell
her story to Madame St. Aubert; while we sat
huddled together in the schoolroom for the rest of
the day, talking in whispers, and making wild
conjectures as to what would happen next.
</p>

<p>
'What a long, dreary evening it was!  For once in
our lives, we younger ones were glad when bed-time
came&mdash;though, to be sure, Lucy Fordyce was seized
with a crying fit; and I, for the first time in my life
woke up, screaming, in the middle of the night, being
quite convinced that I heard the soldiers coming
upstairs to take me away.  Perhaps I really did hear
some one moving about; for the next morning
neither Madame St. Aubert nor Pauline, who slept in
her mother's room, appeared at breakfast.
Mrs. Fortescue read prayers; and when the looks of
astonishment and inquiry directed towards their
empty places became too numerous to be borne any
longer in silence, she told us that Madame St. Aubert
had thought it best, both for her own safety and that of
her pupils, to leave England for a short time.  On
account of the unsettled state of the country, it was
necessary that the journey should be performed as
quickly and secretly as possible, which was the reason
why she had not been able to bid us farewell.  But
Pauline had left many affectionate messages for us all,
and had said we were to wish her and her mother a
safe journey, and speedy return.
</p>

<p>
'"As to yourselves, young ladies," Mrs. Fortescue
went on, "you need not be in any fear for your own
safety.  Colonel Kirke does not imprison children;
and if he did, you would be in no danger, for you
have done nothing to deserve it.  It is important that
Madame St. Aubert should arrive safely in France;
and therefore I am sure that I can trust you all to be
silent and discreet on the subject of her journey, and
on all other matters connected with this&mdash;ahem&mdash;this
unfortunate business.  I wish everything to go on
as if she was here; so, after breakfast, you will be
pleased to get your books, and we will continue our
studies as usual."
</p>

<p>
'The conclusion of this speech was so remarkably
commonplace, and Mrs. Fortescue so entirely everyday
and matter-of-fact, as she sat at the head of the
table pouring out mugs of milk and water, that our
confidence was a good deal restored; and when the milk
and water and thick slices of bread and butter had
quite disappeared, we set about our tasks almost
cheerfully&mdash;I, for one, glad to have something to do
which might help me, for a time at least, to forget
the dreadful things which could be seen out of
Ph[oe]be's bedroom window.
</p>

<p>
'Not a word did Mrs. Fortescue ever say about
Madame St. Aubert's sudden journey; but a rumour
came round to us through Mary Seymour, who heard
it from Molly the cook (who must, I fear, have
listened at the keyhole), that Mrs. Fortescue had done
all she could to persuade Madame to stay&mdash;had told
her that her flight would bring suspicion on the whole
house&mdash;and that, moreover, it was her duty to remain
and protect the girls under her charge.  Mrs. Fortescue
had flatly refused to go herself; and therefore it was
clear, as Molly said, that there was "a deal more stuff
in her than in that Frenchified woman, for all her
stiffness and stand-off manners."  These very manners
had caused Mrs. Fortescue to be anything but a
favourite with us hitherto.  We looked upon her only
in the light of a person whom it was impossible to
satisfy with a half-learnt lesson, and who could be
very cross if we were inattentive or careless, or made
mistakes about things which we knew quite well.
But now, during the days of suspense and terror
which followed close on Madame's departure, we
learnt to like her better than we had ever done
before.  She treated us less like children, and yet
was kinder to us when we behaved childishly.  She
went on with her own work, managing the house, and
hearing the lessons, as if the cruelties of Colonel
Kirke and his men were of no more recent date than
those mentioned in the history of the Maccabees.
And yet she comforted and soothed us when we
sobbed and shivered over the dreadful stories poor
Ph[oe]be was constantly bringing in, so patiently and
gently that we hardly knew her for the same
Mrs. Fortescue who used to scold if we made a single false
stitch in our samplers, and rap our knuckles if we
cried over our sums.
</p>

<p>
'A day or two after Madame St. Aubert's disappearance,
Dr. Power came to see us.  He came in the
evening, with a carter's frock thrown over his black
clothes, and a round hat pulled low on his forehead,
so as partly to conceal his wig.  He was a suspected
man, he said, and did not wish to bring suspicion
on our house too, by being seen to visit it.  He was
very much surprised indeed to find that Madame
St. Aubert was gone.  He raised his eyebrows and
shrugged his shoulders when Mrs. Fortescue told
him this, with an expression which we took to
indicate the most unqualified contempt; though I think
now that there was mixed with it some show of
admiration for her cleverness in having managed her
escape so promptly and successfully.
</p>

<p>
'"Well!" he said at last, "if Madame thought
flight was necessary, it was well she accomplished it
when she did.  I hear that Colonel Kirke's outposts
are more numerous and vigilant than ever; and I
suspect that he has been reprimanded by the authorities
at Whitehall for his system of stringing up the
rank and file of the Duke's followers&mdash;who, poor
souls, have not a penny to buy their lives with&mdash;and
allowing richer folk to purchase a free pass to some
seaport town.  I am no great friend to the King, as
you know, Mrs. Fortescue,"&mdash;here Dr. Power lowered
his voice almost to a whisper,&mdash;-"but I cannot believe
that he approves of these military executions.  They
are shameful, abominable, illegal.  It makes me sick
to see them going on without the power to lift a
finger to save one of the poor creatures,&mdash;young men
that I have christened, and catechized, and married
perhaps!  And all for doing what they were told was
a just and righteous thing.  There'll be a reckoning
for all this some time; but it is my belief that
Colonel Kirke will get his deserts in this world, and I
hope I may live to see the day!"
</p>

<p>
'Dr. Power walked up and down the room in a
state of great agitation, which gradually calmed down
when he saw how we were all staring at him in
frightened silence.
</p>

<p>
'"I crave your pardon, ladies," he said, "for such
an outbreak; but it is enough to make one's blood
boil in one's veins to see such wholesale slaughter."
</p>

<p>
'Then he told us that more than a thousand people
belonging to Taunton, suspected of having assisted
the Duke of Monmouth, had been arrested and
thrown into prison, where they would remain, awaiting
their trial, until the beginning of the next assizes.
He begged Mrs. Fortescue to be very careful to avoid
all suspicion of having favoured the Duke, and to
keep her young ladies within the precincts of the
house and garden; for they would only see horrible
sights if they went further.  And, moreover, it was
best to keep as quiet as possible while Colonel Kirke
was in Taunton.
</p>

<p>
'Then the kind old Doctor bade us good-bye, and
went sadly away, after carefully arranging his disguise,
which, I remember, struck me at the time as being
more likely to attract attention than to divert it&mdash;the
effect, on the whole, being so very unnatural and
peculiar.  The next day we heard that he had been
arrested.  Well, I must not dwell any longer on that
dreary time, for I have still much to tell.  Bad as
those days were, there were still worse to come, as we
very soon found, when the terrible Judge Jeffreys
arrived in Taunton.  We had heard of his cruel deeds
at Winchester&mdash;of the terrible fate of poor Dame
Alice Lisle, sentenced to death for granting a hiding-place
in her house to some of the rebels; and now he
had come to hold the assizes here, in the very same
town with us.  I remember Mrs. Fortescue's look
when the news came that he was actually in Taunton.
Every tinge of colour faded out of her face,&mdash;out of
her lips even,&mdash;and I thought she was going to faint;
but she recovered herself, and tried to be more cheerful
than usual for the rest of the day.  Still that did
not blind us.  We could see clearly enough how
uneasy she really was; and indeed I think all our
hearts sank from the moment we heard those tidings;
for, as Henrietta said, with a foreboding shudder, "If
he could condemn an old gentlewoman like Dame
Alice Lisle to be burnt, only for hiding a rebel, no
fault could be small enough for him to spare."
</p>

<p>
'"Ay; and no punishment too cruel for his hard
heart," cried Bessie passionately&mdash;"nobody insignificant
enough to be passed over.  Madame St. Aubert
did well to escape so soon.  I would we were all with
her."
</p>

<p>
'From the depths of our hearts we echoed Bessie's
wish; and with only too good reason, as you will
very soon see.
</p>

<p>
'The next morning, before we were more than half
dressed, a succession of thundering knocks at the hall
door, and sundry violent peals of the bell, brought all
our toilets to a sudden standstill.  There was a
moment's startled silence in the room; then a
burst of exclamations, and a rush to the window, from
which nothing was to be seen except a few ragged
boys standing about near our gate.  Presently there
was a murmur of strange voices in the house, and
after a while a ringing scream from Ph[oe]be on the
stairs.  The next minute we heard her rush into the
room where the elder girls slept, and, with one
consent, we followed her there.
</p>

<p>
'"Do speak, Ph[oe]be! for Heaven's sake, tell us
what is the matter," Bessie was saying, with an impatient
stamp, as we entered; but "Alack, alack, alack!"
was Ph[oe]be's only answer, as she leaned against the
door-post, gasping and sobbing, and wringing her
hands, until Henrietta silently offered her some
water; after drinking which she became a little more
coherent.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, well-day! poor dear ladies!  Lord have
mercy upon us!  They've come at last, as I've
always feared they would, ever since Madame went
away."
</p>

<p>
'We looked at one another in dumb horror.
</p>

<p>
'"They've come!" repeated Henrietta slowly.  "And
whom do they want, Ph[oe]be?  What do they say?"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, they want Madame, to be sure, and Mistress
Pauline&mdash;only, they're gone.  And now we are all
arrested.  I heard them say so&mdash;Madame Fortescue,
and all of you, arrested in the King's name.
Good-lack! good-lack!  We shall all be hanged, and
burnt, and made slaves, and what not.  I knew how
it would be when that wicked, murdering knave,
Judge Jeffreys, came to Taunton.  Poor dear young
ladies! where shall we all be this time to-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
'Of course this question could only be answered by
a chorus of sobs, lamentations, and exclamations
of all kinds, in the midst of which in came
Mrs. Fortescue, pale and grave as she had always been of
late, but with something in her face that looked
almost more like indignation than fear.  Her presence
quieted us directly; and we listened to her, and
obeyed her in trembling silence, when she told us to
finish our dressing as quickly as possible, for that
there was a gentleman down-stairs who wished to put
some questions to us.  She stayed in the elder girls'
room for a few moments after we left it, and then we
heard her go down-stairs, followed by the still
weeping Ph[oe]be.
</p>

<p>
'"Silly wench," Mrs. Fortescue was saying as they
passed our door, "what need is there for you to fret
yourself in this way?  You are safe enough.  Would
we were all in such small peril!"
</p>

<p>
'The words rang in my ears.  We really were,
then, in some great danger.  It had not proceeded
from Ph[oe]be's frightened imagination.  I clung to
Bessie's side, when, having made ourselves ready, we
at length proceeded, slowly and reluctantly,
downstairs, and whispered to her imploringly to tell me
what Mrs. Fortescue had said after we younger girls
had been sent back to our own room.
</p>

<p>
'"Ph[oe]be was right," she answered in a low, scared
tone.  "Two of the sheriff's officers have come,
and we are all put under arrest for having aided
and abetted the Duke of Monmouth, they said,
They spoke very roughly to Mrs. Fortescue.  She
scarcely knows what to fear.  Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"  But
here Bessie broke off with a nervous start; for as we
reached the foot of the stairs the door of the north
parlour opened, and Mrs. Fortescue beckoned us in.  I
thought, as I crept in behind Bessie, of that fatal day
when Pauline had told us of the mysterious,
ill-favoured stranger closeted with her mother in this
very room.  There were two strange men there this
morning&mdash;one decidedly ill-favoured, and both highly
unprepossessing.
</p>

<p>
'One of the two was in the dress of a sheriff's
officer; the other a spare, mean-looking little man, in
a suit of rusty black.  This man did not even rise
from his seat as we entered.  His companion had the
grace to make a sort of swaggering bow before he
asked Bessie, the tallest and eldest-looking amongst us,
"whether she would be pleased to tell him her name."  Poor
Bessie!  "Elizabeth Davenant" was spoken in
such very low, tremulous tones that she was obliged
to repeat it; whereupon he smiled complacently,
murmuring, "Ay, even so," while the man in black
noted it down on his tablets.  This proceeding struck
me with much awe; but think, what was my horror
when I heard the next question: "And which is the
Countess of Desmond?"  Most unwillingly I was
pushed forward by Mary Seymour, and immediately
my name was inscribed upon the tablets, the sheriff's
officer remarking meanwhile, "Sooth to say, she is a
mighty little lady."  How well I remember the pang
of mortification which these words gave me even then,
when I was absolutely quaking with fright.  He
turned next to Eleanor Page, and then to Henrietta,
and so on, till all our names had been noted down by
the little man with the tablets.
</p>

<p>
'"And these are all of the pupils, madam?"
demanded the sheriff's man (Master Noakes his
companion called him) of Mrs. Fortescue.
</p>

<p>
'"These are all," she repeated mechanically.
</p>

<p>
'"Very good, very good," Master Noakes proceeded,
as with his back against the wall, and his
arms folded, he surveyed us all critically.  "And
now, ladies, mayhap you'll be good enough to answer
a few questions that I'm going to put to you; and
look you, I must have the truth, and nothing more or
less.  You won't find it easy to hoodwink me, I
warrant."
</p>

<p>
'These insolent words, and the threatening manner
in which they were spoken, made some of us grow
white with terror, while others reddened with
indignation.  I saw Henrietta's hand clench involuntarily,
and she bit her lip till it bled.
</p>

<p>
'"Now, Mrs. Elizabeth Davenant," Master Noakes
continued, "you can't deny that you and all your
schoolmates here presented a silk banner to that
notorious rebel and traitor the late Duke of
Monmouth, when he proclaimed himself king here on the
twentieth of June last."
</p>

<p>
'"I have no wish to deny it, sir," replied Bessie,
plucking up her courage a little in her anger and
offended pride.  "It was I myself who gave the banner
into the Duke's hand."
</p>

<p>
'"But on behalf of you all?  These ladies were all
with you?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, all; that is, except Mistress Sidney."
</p>

<p>
'"And you all helped to deck out the house with
flowers and garlands the day that the Duke made his
first entry into Taunton?"
</p>

<p>
'"All but Mistress Sidney, who would have nought
to do with it."
</p>

<p>
'Master Noakes stared at Henrietta, and then
smiled disagreeably, and winked at his friend.
</p>

<p>
'"And pray, which among you worked this fine
banner of yours?" was his next question.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose I did not quite realize the danger of
our position even then, for I remember feeling more
elated than frightened as I stepped forward with the
seven other girls, all older than myself, who had
joined in the embroidery of the banner.
</p>

<p>
'"What!  My Lady Desmond too?" remarked this
detestable man in his bold, familiar way.  "Can your
little ladyship really do such dainty handiwork?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, indeed, sir!" was my prompt and indignant
reply.  "I worked more than half the unicorn."  Whereupon
Master Noakes laughed, and Mrs. Fortescue
gave a quick, uneasy glance towards me, as if
somewhat anxious to hear what more I might be
going to communicate.  But Master Noakes asked
no more of me just then.  After putting one or two
questions to some of the other girls, he turned to
Mrs. Fortescue, saying:
</p>

<p>
'"Then, madam, as I notified to you just now, I
am commanded to arrest yourself and all these ladies
in the King's name.  A guard will be placed in the
house, and no member of the household will leave it
until the King's pleasure be further known."
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Fortescue only bent her head in reply to this
speech; but I fancied that there was a look of relief
in her face, as if she had expected something worse.
We all stood in dead silence for some moments,
hardly daring even to look at one another.  Ph[oe]be's
news had been only too true.  We were all
prisoners&mdash;prisoners in our own house!  And what the King's
pleasure would be with regard to our further disposal
I longed to ask, but dared not.  But the worst had
not come, after all.  The little man in black broke
the silence first by rising and counselling Master
Noakes to go on and make an end of the affair as
speedily as possible, as he had work enough
before him, and could afford to waste no more time.
I thought that making an end of the affair must
mean than they were going to take their departure,
and leave us to the care of the aforesaid guard, the
idea of which frightened me very much.  But no;
they were not going away.  The worst had not come,
after all.  Master Noakes's next words made my
heart beat so fast, that I thought I should be choked.
</p>

<p>
'"I have a graver charge yet to bring forward,"
he said in a much more peremptory tone than he had
used hitherto.  "Mistress Davenant, Mistress Sidney,
and my little Lady Countess here, can you deny that
you knew of Monmouth's treasonable schemes full
three days before he landed at Lyme, and that you
sent money to him through his agent, Colonel Dare?"
</p>

<p>
'No one answered.  Bessie tried to speak, but her
voice died away into a whisper; and she could only
cast an imploring, frightened glance at Mrs. Fortescue,
who, resolved to make one last effort on behalf of her
pupils, came forward and said in a tone of intense
earnestness:
</p>

<p>
'"Once more, sir, let me remind you that these
poor children cannot be answerable for the part
they took in this matter.  Whatever they have
done, if not by Madame St. Aubert's express desire,
was at least with her permission.  You see what
children, what mere babes, some of them are.  What
can such as they do for good or for ill in such high
matters?  It were surely the most cruel, shameful
injustice&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"I pray you, madam, to hold your peace, and let
them speak for themselves," interrupted Master
Noakes, waving his hand authoritatively.
</p>

<p>
'"Let me at least say this much," persisted
Mrs. Fortescue, not daunted by his rough words and
imperious manner: "Mistress Henrietta Sidney
neither gave money to Colonel Dare, nor had aught
to do with the decorations, or the banner; and as to
her knowledge of the Duke's coming, it was by
simple chance that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"No matter&mdash;no matter," quoth Master Noakes,
cutting her short again.  "She shall tell her own tale,
I say.  Now then, mistress," and he beckoned
imperiously to Henrietta.  "You heard what I said.
Come, speak out, yea or nay?"
</p>

<p>
'"I did know of the Duke of Monmouth's plot full
three days before he landed," she began firmly, after
a moment's hesitation, "but I did not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Pshaw! no 'buts;' we can't wait for 'buts.'  You
admit that you did know; that's quite enough."  Then
he repeated his question to Bessie and me, and the
little man with the tablets jotted down our answers
as before, looking at us at the same time with a grim,
half-amused, half-contemptuous smile, which was
more disagreeable than I can describe.  A strange
chill of fear crept over me when I had whispered
"yes" to Master Noakes's query.  For the first time I
saw that the danger coming upon us was very real
and very near, and that there was no one to save us
from it.  I shall never forget how cold and sick with
terror I felt for the next few minutes.  It was a
sensation that I had never known before.  Bessie's answer
was firm and frank&mdash;given in one of her impulsive
bursts of courage; and she made a vigorous attempt
to show Henrietta's innocence, and to take upon
herself all blame for my share in what Master Noakes
called "these treasonable doings;" but she was
silenced as summarily as Mrs. Fortescue, and
Henrietta herself, had been.  And then at last we
heard our fate&mdash;part of our fate at least: we were to
be taken to prison; to jail!&mdash;and what would come
afterwards we dreaded to imagine.  It was for
Judge Jeffreys to decide that,&mdash;Judge Jeffreys, of
whom lately we had not been able even to
think without hatred and horror.  This sentence
overwhelmed us all three.  I burst into tears, and
Bessie, after struggling for a moment to control
herself, did likewise.  Henrietta shed no tears: she
made some incoherent, half-choked exclamation, and
then stood quite silent; while the colour faded slowly
out of her face, and she trembled so much that she
was obliged to lean against the wall.  Again
Mrs. Fortescue tried to speak for us, doing her best to keep
back the bitter indignation that was expressed plainly
enough in her countenance.  But in vain she forced
herself to be calm and moderate, and to remonstrate
as gently as possible against the cruelty of shutting
up young girls of our age and rank in the common
jail of Taunton.  In vain she implored that, if we
must go, she might be allowed to go with us;
and, when that was refused, tried to secure a promise
that at least we should be placed in a room by
ourselves.  The terrible fever known to be raging in the
jail at this time was, she pleaded, reason enough for
this&mdash;to say nothing of the sort of companions
among whom we were likely to be thrown in such
a place.  But not the slightest effect did these
arguments seem to have upon the two agents of Judge
Jeffreys.  They flatly refused to give the promise for
which she begged so earnestly; and as to allowing
her to accompany us, that was quite out of the
question.  She must stay to superintend her own
imprisoned household, until it was settled what was
to become of them.  After that, her wish to see the
inside of a jail might, doubtless, be complied with.
Then they urged us to make ready for departure,
without more loss of time; and Mrs. Fortescue,
seeing that remonstrance was utterly useless, and in
fact only likely to make matters worse, led the way
out of the room, silently motioning to us to follow
her&mdash;some crying audibly, some clinging together,
hardly venturing to exchange remarks in half-stifled
whispers, but all darting back nervous, anxious
glances to see if Master Noakes was keeping a close
and watchful eye on our movements.  Yes, there he
was close behind us; but, to our intense relief, he
came no further than the first landing-place, and
there took up his station, contenting himself with
shouting, now a remark to his friend at the foot of
the stairs, now an injunction to us in the room above
to bestir ourselves about our preparations, or he
would come and pack up our baggage himself.  Oh,
what a relief it was to shut the doors, and feel that at
length we might speak without every word we uttered
being noted down; and what a scene of confusion
began now we were no longer under restraint.  Bessie
gave way entirely the instant she found herself in
her own room.  She threw herself upon the bed,
and cried and sobbed so passionately that I felt
almost appalled.  This only was wanted to set
flowing the tears of a good many more among us,&mdash;of
Agnes Blount among the rest, who clung round my
neck, weeping as if her heart would break.  I had
never before known how much we cared for each
other.  Meanwhile, moving about quietly amidst the
buzz of voices, unmoved and unhindered by the
girls who chattered, the girls who cried, and the girls
who did nothing but stand in the way, Mrs. Fortescue,
with the help of Henrietta and one or two more,
collected the few necessaries that we were to take to our
new quarters, and put them up together in the
smallest possible compass; then, this business
completed, she turned her attention to us.  And we
certainly were in need of it; for by this time Agnes's
grief had infected me, and I was in almost as deplorable
a condition as Bessie.  Henrietta still kept her
self-command, but she did not make any attempt to
comfort us.  Perhaps it was her intense shyness and
reserve that stood in the way, perhaps it was the fear
of breaking down herself&mdash;I do not know which; but
all she did was to pause in her operations, and cast a
wistful look towards me now and then, as if she were
longing to speak, but dared not.  Oh, how I longed
for mamma at that moment!  It seemed to me that
I had never missed her before as I did now&mdash;no, not
on that dismal day of my first coming to school.
Poor mamma! had she any idea, I wondered, of the
great trouble into which her unlucky little daughter
had fallen.
</p>

<p>
'You see, the penny postage had not even been
dreamed of in those days; and such a great event as
the arrival of a letter had only happened to me twice
since my arrival at Madame St. Aubert's.  The last
epistle had been written just after Sedgemoor; and
my mother, little suspecting how my fortunes would
be affected by that disastrous battle, called it "that
most happy and thank-worthy dispensation of Providence,"
and bade me rejoice that the King's enemies
were scattered, and the arch-rebel Monmouth safe
in the Tower.  And I had written an answer to that
letter, but Madame St. Aubert had forbidden me to
say anything about the Bible and the banner; or
indeed to make any allusion to the part which she
and her pupils had taken in the Duke's reception at
Taunton.
</p>

<p>
'"During the disturbed state of the country,"
Madame said, "there was no knowing what might
become of the letter, so it was as well to be as guarded
as possible."
</p>

<p>
'When I thought of these things, I felt quite in
despair about my story ever coming to mamma's ears,
while my longing for her became more intense every
minute.  Presently Mrs. Fortescue's cool, firm hand
was laid on my forehead, and then my arm was round
her, and my burning, tearful eyes hidden upon her
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
'"Poor little maid," she said compassionately, "I
would I could send you safe back again to your
mother.  But, please God, you will see her before
very long.  So cheer up, child; you have nothing
serious to fear&mdash;only a little hardship and discomfort
for a few days, and then you will go home, and all
will be well.  They can't do any hurt to children of
your age.  All they want is a fine from your
parents,&mdash;a heavy one, doubtless; but yours are wealthy
enough to pay it, so you need have no fear.  Poor
Bessie yonder," continued Mrs. Fortescue, lowering
her voice, "has most cause to be affrighted of any of
you."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh madam, why?" I asked, looking up suddenly
into her face, which was turned with an anxious,
pitying expression towards the bed where Bessie still lay
quivering with sobs.
</p>

<p>
'"She has not rich parents, child, like you and
Henrietta: she had only her uncle to care for her,
and he is in London under sentence of death, and all
his property confiscated.  Hush! do not tell her now;
she will know it soon enough, poor child.  I only
learned it myself this morning; and I tell you that
you may see how Bessie wants comfort yet more than
yourself."
</p>

<p>
'"Yes indeed, madam," I whispered, and I dried
my eyes resolutely, and tried my best to feel fearless
and defiant of Judge Jeffreys and all his terrors.
"But oh, madam," I could not help saying from the
depths of my heart, "if they would but let you come
with us."
</p>

<p>
'And then these words were scarcely out of my
mouth when I felt inclined to laugh; for the thought
struck me that a few weeks ago I could not have
believed it possible that any one should really wish
for Mrs. Fortescue's company who had the chance of
being without it.  Perhaps Mrs. Fortescue was thinking
the same thing, for a sudden smile lit up her face
for a moment; but the next it was sad and anxious
as ever, and she said earnestly: "I would I might go
with you, sweetheart, only that perhaps I am as much
needed here.  We are all prisoners, you know&mdash;not
so much better off than you, after all.  There!"&mdash;as
another impatient summons from Master Noakes was
heard from the staircase&mdash;"we must not linger any
more now.  God be with you, child.  Don't be down-hearted;
you have naught to blame yourself for in this
matter.  Say your prayers, and do your duty, and He
will deliver you from evil."
</p>

<p>
'I suppose it was Mrs. Fortescue's manner more
than her words that gave her so much influence over
us all.  We had always looked upon her as a person
to be respected and obeyed; but ever since Madame's
disappearance, she had been more than this.  There was
so much more softness and gentleness about her, and
yet at the same time so much strength and spirit, that
gave one a feeling of having some one to lean upon
as long as she was with us.  Her words had done me
good; and seeing that it was so, she bade me make
ready for departure with as much speed as possible,
and then left me, to do what she could for poor
Bessie's consolation.  What she said, I did not know.
I only saw her bend over the bed, and whisper for a
moment or two; and then, impetuous and sudden as
usual, Bessie sprang up and threw her arms round
Mrs. Fortescue's neck with no more ceremony than if
it had been mine.  Just then came another of Master
Noakes's resounding shouts, which were beginning
to follow one another at shorter and shorter intervals,
becoming every time louder and more peremptory.
Mrs. Fortescue returned the kiss; and then, quietly
unclasping Bessie's arms, began to twist up her pretty
fair hair, which was in the wildest state of disorder
possible.  I think I never saw hair so nearly golden as
Bessie's, nor did I ever see any with such a propensity
for tumbling down.  Ten minutes was the utmost
length of time that those golden locks of hers had been
known to keep smooth and in their place,&mdash;even
Pauline's skill had failed in achieving more than this;
and as for Mrs. Fortescue's hurried attempts to
arrange them, the result would have sent us into fits
of laughter at any other time: but just now nothing
was a laughing matter.
</p>

<p>
'All was ready at last, and Mrs. Fortescue was
trying to cut the numerous farewells as short as
possible, and to impress upon the other girls that they
were on no account to follow us down-stairs, when all
last words were suddenly and effectually broken off
by the tramp of heavy footsteps in the passage, and
the sound of Master Noakes's voice actually close to
the door.
</p>

<p>
'"Not a minute more will I tarry, ladies; so, if
your baggage is not ready, you must e'en come
without it.  D'ye hear?"
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Fortescue quietly opened the door, and, in
her very haughtiest and most coldly polite manner,
motioned him towards the staircase, saying that we
were all ready to start whenever it might be his
pleasure to do so, and suggesting that he should lead
the way down-stairs.  I hardly know what passed
after that.  An odd sort of vague, dreamy feeling
came over me as if I was walking in my sleep, or as
if I was not myself.  A most uncomfortable sensation
it was, like nothing I had ever felt before; and though
I suppose it must have been brought on by fright, yet
somehow I was less conscious of fear than at first.
I began to fancy that perhaps, after all, it was only a
dream, and that I should wake up presently and find
that there had never been a rebellion at all, and that
everything was going on as usual again.  I was still
in this curious kind of dreamy state when I left
Madame St. Aubert's house, never to enter it again.
</p>

<p>
'I remember hearing Mrs. Fortescue beg that we
might be allowed to wait for some breakfast.  It had
never entered my head till then that we had eaten
nothing that morning&mdash;indeed I do not think any of
us remembered it; and when Master Noakes refused,
I believe the only person who really cared was
Mrs. Fortescue.  I did not feel hungry at all, only dull and
stunned, and almost indifferent.  I did not cry now
when Mrs. Fortescue kissed me, though Bessie was
half choked with her uncontrollable sobs; and for the
first time I saw Henrietta's eyes swimming.
</p>

<p>
'She answered with a silent nod to Mrs. Fortescue's
last hurried whisper, "Take care of them, Henrietta.
I trust to you."  And when the door had closed on
Mrs. Fortescue, and we were actually in the conveyance
provided by Master Noakes and his friend the
notary, still that strange sense of being in a dream
could not be shaken off.  I gazed out at the well-known
streets as we drove through the town, and tried
to realize that we were indeed being carried to a
prison; and then I looked at Bessie's tearful face
opposite, and wondered at myself for feeling so
apathetic.  We drew up at last before a large, gloomy
brick building, which I had seen only once before,
and had looked upon with great awe and interest
as "the jail," little dreaming then that the time was
near when I myself should be entering those heavy
iron gates, and lodging behind one of those dismal
grated windows.  The man who opened the door led us
into a long dreary room, that looked almost empty, the
only furniture being a table littered over with papers
and parchments, and one or two wooden benches.
Then Master Noakes, after talking with the man
aside for a few minutes, and pulling out a paper (the
order for our arrest, I suppose), announced that he
was going to wait on the governor; and forthwith
marched out of the room.  We were left meanwhile
under the charge of the little notary, who took not
the slightest notice of us, but amused himself by
sitting upon the table and examining carefully every
one of the documents that were lying there.
</p>

<p>
'One or two words I had caught that had passed
between Master Noakes and the porter&mdash;something
about "no space, and the jail being as full as it would
hold already;" and I fancied that perhaps they
might not be able to take us in, after all, and that we
should be sent back to Mrs. Fortescue.  If it had not
been for the presence of the notary, I should have
asked Bessie or Henrietta; but there seemed a kind
of spell upon me while I watched him sitting so
silently upon the table, turning over the papers with
such absorbing interest.  So I said nothing, and sat
leaning my head upon Henrietta's shoulder until I
really think I should have fallen asleep, had not
Master Noakes suddenly made his appearance again,
bringing with him the governor of the jail.  He was a
worn, sharp-featured, and by no means good-humoured-looking
person, and yet somehow I did not dislike his
face.  Not that he seemed to pity us in the least: he
only stared at us with a perplexed, annoyed kind of
look, and then said in a fretful, injured tone, as if he
alone was the ill-used person:
</p>

<p>
'"So ill-considered to bring them here just
now! when I scarcely know how to bestow those who are
already here.  His worship should have some reason
in his commands.  I tell you, sir, that the place is
packed to overflowing as it is; and what with the
fever too, 'tis enough to drive a man almost out of
his wits."
</p>

<p>
'"That is no business of mine," replied the notary,
getting off the table to salute the governor.  "The
order for the arrest of these young ladies is signed, as
you see, by the Lord Chief-Justice himself.  You
won't care to go against that, I fancy."
</p>

<p>
'"But the house is to be guarded too, you say: why
cannot they remain there?"
</p>

<p>
'The notary drew his companion away from our
end of the room, and whispered in his ear.  I could
only catch the words "wealthy parents," which I
remembered because I had heard Mrs. Fortescue use
the same expression; and then he added in rather a
louder tone: "Colonel Dare openly boasted that he
was in communication with members of families of
distinction residing in Taunton, even before the
landing of the Duke of Monmouth.  It has been proved
that Elizabeth Davenant, Henrietta Sidney, and
Frances Countess of Desmond were among the
number.  They supplied him with money, and were
privy to the secret of the Duke's intended landing,
three days before it took place.  The rest of Madame
St. Aubert's pupils are only accused of working and
presenting a banner, as you doubtless remember."
</p>

<p>
"I remember the fact of the banner being presented,"
was the reply.  "But what became of the
governess?"
</p>

<p>
'"She passed Kirke's outposts by means of a bribe,
and got safe off to France," replied this dreadful
little notary, who appeared to know everything.  "She
escaped just in time too; for 'twas only the day after,
that orders came down from London that no exceptions
were to be made to the rule of arresting
suspected persons.  And not too soon either: Kirke
was getting very lax.  The law should be allowed to
take its just course, sir, without all these exceptions
and relaxations."
</p>

<p>
'"The law will have plenty to do here, then,"
said the governor in the same peevish tone of voice
he had used before.  "Three hundred prisoners here
already; and to ask me to take in more!  Well, I
cannot gainsay your order, sir; but if these be ladies
of quality, they will scarce relish the company I shall
be forced to give them."
</p>

<p>
'"Prisoners must not expect good company," said
the notary, glancing at us carelessly.  "As long as
you have them in safe keeping, his lordship will be
satisfied.  Master Noakes, it is time we were going.
I wish you a good morning, sir; and the same to you,
ladies."  And, saluting us with something between a
touch of the hat and a nod, Master Noakes and his
companion strode out of the room.
</p>

<p>
'I was so much relieved to see them disappear, and
to hear the ponderous door close after them, that my
spirits rose again considerably; and in spite of the
presence of the governor I ventured to whisper, "Oh
Bessie, I am so hungry; couldn't you ask if we
might have some breakfast?"
</p>

<p>
'The governor did not make any objection, though
he looked as if Bessie was asking a great favour when
she made the request in rather a trembling voice.  I
thought him what I called "cross," but I really
believe now he was as kind to us as he dared to be,
and kinder than prison rule permitted.  He took us
to his wife, who made us very comfortable, gave us
plenty to eat, and petted me so much that I began to
cry when the turnkey arrived to take us away
from her.  All my fright came back at the sight of
his face and the sound of his jingling keys.  "Why
can't we stay here, madam?" I sobbed, taking fast
hold of my new friend's gown.  "I shouldn't mind
being in prison, if we might.  We would promise not
to run away; and you might lock the door whenever
you went out of the room.  I don't want to see any
more strange people; let me stay with you."
</p>

<p>
'"My poor little maid, I wish I could keep you,"
she said, kissing me.  "But it is impossible.  I should
only be bringing you and all of us into trouble.  I
have kept you over long as it is, I am afraid."  So
saying, she thrust a cake into my hand, patted me on
the shoulder, and pushed me gently towards Bessie,
who put her arm round me, and led me from the
room.  I went on crying all the time we were following
the turnkey through many long, dark stone passages,
up steps and down steps, round corners and
past closed doors, from behind which echoed noises,
which caused us to quicken our steps to a run till we
were safe out of hearing.  At last our guide stopped
before one of these, and began turning over his bunch
to find the right key.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, not there!" exclaimed Bessie in dismay; for
the sounds of loud talking, shrill laughter, quarrelling,
and swearing came to our ears so plainly, that even
Henrietta looked frightened, and Bessie covered her
ears with her hands to shut out the noise.
</p>

<p>
'"This is the women's ward," said the turnkey as
he fitted one of his keys into the lock.  "And here
you will have to stay until your case comes on for
trial."
</p>

<p>
'"If we could have a room to ourselves!" began
Henrietta imploringly, pulling out her purse as
she spoke.  (She was the only one of us who had
been sensible enough to bring one.)
</p>

<p>
'"'Tis impossible, mistress," said the jailer&mdash;"for
to-night, at least.  Well," as she put some money
into his hand, "perhaps to-morrow there may be a
room vacant.  Folk don't stay very long here in
these days."  He gave a kind of ghastly grin as he
spoke; and Henrietta turned suddenly away from
him, looking quite white and sick.  Then the heavy
door began to creak on its hinges, and presently we
found ourselves face to face with our fellow-prisoners.
The noisy tongues stopped the moment the door
was opened, and all heads were turned to look at us.
Very confusing we found it to be stared at by so
many pairs of eager eyes at once.  The room, large
as it was, seemed to me, at the first glance, to be
quite full of people.  There were women of all ages
there&mdash;from eighteen to eighty&mdash;and of all ranks, too,
apparently; for though most of them were rough,
hard-featured, and bold-looking, there were some who
were evidently ladies, and who seemed nearly as ill
at ease as we felt ourselves to be.  But there were
no children, and a murmur of compassion ran through
the crowd when they saw me.  I suppose I did look
very dismal; for my face was covered with tears, and
I held Bessie with a sort of desperate clutch, as if she
was my only protection, and our new abode a den of
wild beasts.  When the turnkey had shut the door
behind us and gone away, a chorus of exclamations
and questions was showered down upon us, which
had the effect of frightening me more than ever, until
I discovered that they were all of a friendly nature;
and, in fact, that every one seemed to pity me nearly
as much as I pitied myself.  "Poor child!  What a
babe to be here!  What has she done?"  "One of
my Lord Jeffrey's arrests, of course."  "'Tis a cruel
shame.  She can't be more than ten years old."
</p>

<p>
'"What's your name, my little mistress?" asked
several voices; and in spite of my fright I managed
to sob out: "Frances Dalrymple&mdash;I mean Cary;
and I was eleven last birthday."
</p>

<p>
'This piece of information was received with a
burst of laughter, which quite checked my desire for
making any more confidences; and I left Henrietta
and Bessie to answer all the numerous questions
which followed.  Quite a little crowd collected round
us to hear our story; and every one was loud in
expressing indignation at the injustice of our arrest.
But their sympathy alarmed me almost as much as
everything else about them.  They called the Lord
Jeffreys such dreadful names.  One woman swore, and
clenched her fist whenever she mentioned him; and
they became so excited and talked so loud when
they began telling their own misfortunes, that I was
glad when they got tired of talking to us, and one by
one sauntered off to join other groups, and we were
left in our corner unmolested.  What a long, dreary
morning that was!  The only break in its monotony
was the arrival of dinner, when we sat amidst a long
row of our companions at the great deal table, and
were served with bowls of greasy, watery broth, in
which little bits of mutton were floating about.  I
was not at all hungry, but I was nevertheless both
surprised and horrified when my next neighbour plunged
her spoon into my bowl, and carried off the greater
part of my meat.  What remained looked less inviting
than ever; so I begged her to take it all if she
liked, and I ate the cake the governor's wife had
given me instead.  The girl looked slightly ashamed
of herself when she saw Henrietta's eyes fixed upon
her from the other side of the table, and turning to
me, asked if I had had enough to eat.  I said, "Yes,
thank you," very politely.  I was so afraid of her,
that I think I should have said "yes" at any rate.
But when I looked at her thin, pale face, I did not
grudge her my dinner in the least, she looked so
starved and miserable.
</p>

<p>
'"I thought you looked as if you did not care for
it," she said.  "When you have been here as long
as I have, you will learn to take what is put before
you the minute you get it, and be glad enough of it
too."
</p>

<p>
'I could not help wondering whether I should also
learn to take what was put before other people.  But
of course I did not dare to say so, and she went on in
a tone of apology:
</p>

<p>
'"I'm just getting well of the fever.  That's what
makes me so hungry, I suppose.  I never do get
enough to eat here."
</p>

<p>
'"Were you very ill?" I ventured to ask, feeling
rather sorry that I had eaten my cake so quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I believe so.  I don't remember much about
it.  They told me I nearly died.  There was one in
the next bed to me that did."
</p>

<p>
'Bessie, who sat on the other side of me, gave a
little start as she heard these words; but she did not
say anything, and the girl went on.
</p>

<p>
'"I wished then that I had died too.  I should
have been out of this place then; but somehow I got
better and better, and to-day I have come in here for
the first time."
</p>

<p>
'"How long have you been in prison?" I asked,
getting quite interested.
</p>

<p>
'"Ever since two days after the Battle of Sedgemoor."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, how dreadful!  And why?"
</p>

<p>
'"Because I gave the Duke of Monmouth a loaf of
bread when he changed his clothes at my father's
house, and bade God speed him," she replied.  "And the
next day the soldiers came looking for him, and father
let it all out.  So they took us both away, and
brought me here; and what became of father I don't
know to this day.  I have never seen him since."
</p>

<p>
'By this time I had quite forgiven the loss of my
dinner, and was not at all surprised when Bessie
leant across me, with tears in her eyes, to say:
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, I'm so glad you did that!  How proud you
must feel of it.  I would have given anything to have
helped the Duke so."
</p>

<p>
'"It did him no good, poor gentleman," said the girl.
"He was found, for all the pains we took to disguise
him; and the King had him beheaded.  Ah! well.
I felt very sorry when I heard it first; for he was a
kind gentleman, and a well-favoured.  But I don't
care now.  He has brought so much trouble on us
all, that I almost feel to hate him."
</p>

<p>
'"But he did not know.  How could he guess that
there would be all these dreadful executions?  The
King is responsible for them, not he," said Bessie,
eager as ever in defence of her hero.  "Besides he
was fighting for his rights.  Oh, I wish I had been
able to do something for him!"
</p>

<p>
'"Don't talk to me of his rights!" said the girl
fiercely.  "If it had not been for him, I should have
been at home and happy at this day; and so would
you, and many another poor creature.  Besides, what
are his rights compared to all our lives, I should like
to know?"
</p>

<p>
'"But surely, surely," cried I, "they can't punish
you very much for merely giving him a loaf of
bread?"
</p>

<p>
'"You don't know what you are talking of," she
replied gloomily.  "Haven't you heard enough about Judge
Jeffreys since he has been in Taunton, to know that
there is no punishment too hard for him to give,
unless he is well paid to be merciful.  You are ladies
of quality: you will get off well enough, I warrant
me; but I come of poor folk, and there is no greater
crime than that in his eyes."
</p>

<p>
'I thought of what Mrs. Fortescue had said, and a
chill crept over me.  I sat quite silent all the rest of
dinner-time, conjuring up all the dreadful stories I had
heard from Ph[oe]be of Judge Jeffreys' cruelties.  I
thought of the men and women he had pilloried and
flogged; of the twenty-nine men who were executed
at Dorchester in a single day; of Mrs. Gaunt; of
Lady Lisle; and of many another story too horrible
to repeat to you, until I felt quite sick with fright.
"What could be done to save Bessie from the hands
of this wicked man?"  I pondered vainly for some
time; but suddenly a bright idea struck me, which I
resolved to confide to Henrietta the moment dinner
was over.  I did not want Bessie to hear; so I felt
rather glad that she went on talking to the pale girl,
and allowed me to slip from her side after dinner
without taking any notice.  Then I pulled Henrietta away
into a corner of the room, and poured out all my
fears.  That they were but too well founded, I saw
directly from her face.  She, too, had heard what
Mrs. Fortescue told me of the fate of poor Sir Geoffrey
Davenant.  Bessie stood in real, terrible peril; there
was no doubt about it.  Henrietta trembled all over
when she said this, but she begged me not to let
Bessie know.
</p>

<p>
'"She must be saved," said Henrietta in a quick,
agitated tone.  "I don't know how; but, in some way
or other, it shall be done."
</p>

<p>
'"Don't you think, Henrietta," I said, keeping my
voice steady with great difficulty, "that if my father
and mother are as rich as everybody says they are,
they could pay the ransom for Bessie as well as for
me?  I could write and tell them all about it,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, to be sure.  What a good thought, Frances!
What was I about, not to think of it before?  I'll
write to my father too.  Perhaps between them they
might manage.  They might petition the King.
We won't despair.  There are many worse off than
we are, child."
</p>

<p>
'"Where shall we get paper and pens and ink?" I
said, longing to begin, but casting a despairing glance
round the room which was bare of any furniture
but the table, and a couple of long benches on either
side of it.
</p>

<p>
'"I have got them all in my trunk.  Mrs. Fortescue
thought of that," replied Henrietta.  "She never
forgets anything, I believe."
</p>

<p>
'It was a great comfort to have something to do.  My
fears for Bessie did not make me quite so unhappy
when I was telling mamma all about them.  Writing
home made me feel less lonely; and, besides, there was
the hope (I tried hard to think the certainty) that an
answer to my petition would set all our misgivings at
rest, and prove that my father was able and willing
to pay any amount of money rather than that a hair
of Bessie's head should be injured.
</p>

<p>
'Thus the afternoon slipped away much more
quickly than the morning had done.  Writing a letter
was a serious business, and absorbed all our attention.
Even Henrietta, who was considered one of the most
accomplished of Madame St. Aubert's young ladies,
proceeded very slowly, and paused a long time when
she had to spell a difficult word; while, as for my
epistle, it was so disfigured by blots, tears, bad
writing, and mistakes, that I began to have grave doubts,
as I went down, whether mamma would be able to
read it.  Then I had to consider what I had better
say to interest my father in Bessie's case.  I was so
afraid of him, that I doubt if anything short of
Bessie's danger would have made me bold enough to
ask him a favour; but I would have done anything
for her, and so I laboured away till my fingers were
soaked with ink, and my head ached with composing
sentences that should be as respectful as mamma
could think necessary, and at the same time as urgent
as I could make them.
</p>

<p>
'Bessie came to see what we were doing after a time,
and said mournfully that her writing to her uncle
was of no use, for she did not know where he was.
She had never heard a word from him since the Battle
of Sedgemoor.  I was so afraid that she would see
what I had written about poor Sir Geoffrey, that I
put my arm on my letter, while I drew Bessie down
to give her an affectionate kiss, and in consequence
made the blots ten times worse.  Then I laughed
hysterically; and if it had not been for the example
set me by Henrietta's grave face, I should have
revealed the whole truth then and there.
</p>

<p>
'"How do you mean to send the letter?" asked
Bessie, when she had comforted me for the blots by
the assurance that mamma would not care.
</p>

<p>
'"I shall give them to the jailer next time I see
him," replied Henrietta, "and beg him to give them
into the keeping of the first letter-carrier that rides
from Taunton.  I think he will do it, especially if I
give him a little money.  He was not nearly so rough
with us as that dreadful Master Noakes."
</p>

<p>
'"Don't let any one see you, then," said Bessie,
lowering her voice.  "That girl I was talking to but
a moment ago, told me there are some women here
who will never rest till they get every farthing of
your money, if you let them find out that you have
any.  They bribe the jailer to get them drink
whenever they can scrape a little money together, and
then the noise they make is fearful."
</p>

<p>
'Bessie glanced, as she spoke, to the further end
of the room, where sat a group of those women who
had frightened us so much in the morning by their
loud voices and reckless language.  They were playing
cards with a very greasy pack, and had done little
else but quarrel over their game ever since dinner.
The noise they made was distracting enough now, and
what it would be when they were excited by drink
we trembled to imagine.  Alas! we knew only too
well before the evening was over; for though
Henrietta's purse remained safe hidden in her bosom,
the prisoners found some other means of getting what
they wanted, and the scene which ensued is beyond
my power to describe.  I do not suppose any of us
were as fastidious as you would be now.  For a
gentleman to drink more wine than was good for
him, was so sadly common in those days, that we
had all seen instances of it in our own homes or
amongst our father's guests; but the revel which was
held in that wretched room was unlike anything we
had ever seen before.  We could only cower into a
corner and try to remain blind and deaf to the shouts,
the songs, the fighting, and quarrelling that were
going on around us, and which continued, it seemed
to me, hour after hour, until sleep overpowered the
most noisy of the revellers, and they sank down, one
after another, on the heaps of straw, which were their
only beds.  Silence reigned again, broken only by
the deep snores which announced that our dreaded
companions would alarm us no longer.  The rest of
the prisoners soon followed their example; and we
were left the only wakeful ones, talking in frightened
whispers, and not daring to move from our cramped
position, lest we should rouse some of those still
shapeless figures which lay ranged around the floor.
How strange it was to sit there in the dim light
watching the shadows grow blacker as the moon rose
and peeped in at the high, narrow window.  Bessie's
golden hair looked pale and unnatural as the cold,
white light fell upon it; and I hardly knew the pale,
grave face for the same as the merry, bright one I
loved so well.  Yes, that night was indeed a miserable
one.  Even now it makes me quite melancholy whenever
I think of it.  I remember falling repeatedly into
a kind of half-doze, and waking with a violent start
each time from the same dream.  I thought Master
Noakes was trying to push me down-stairs.  I did at
last fall into a restless, uncomfortable sleep for a few
hours, but all the time I never seemed quite to forget
where I was; and when I woke at dawn, it was with
a consciousness of something terrible hanging over
me, though I could not at first distinctly recall what
it was.  So I raised my head from Henrietta's lap (it
was on Bessie's I had gone to sleep), and looked
round the great dismal room.  Everything rushed
back into my mind in a moment then: all the painful
events of the day before&mdash;the past trouble and fear,
and, what was yet worse, the dread of what might
be to come.  Henrietta was awake: she was sitting
upright, supporting herself against the stone wall, and
looking miserably white and tired, as if she had not
slept the whole night.
</p>

<p>
'"Why Henrietta?" I began.
</p>

<p>
'"Hush! don't disturb her;" and she pointed to
Bessie, who was lying with her head resting on one
arm.  "She is sleeping more quietly now, but for a
long time she moaned and muttered, and tossed
about so restlessly, that I was quite frightened.  I
was obliged to move your head on to my knee, for
fear she should wake you."
</p>

<p>
'"But, Henrietta," I whispered, "have not you
been asleep at all yourself?"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh yes; I believe I slept for a little while, until
Bessie woke me by muttering in such a strange way.
I am afraid she must be ill.  Look at her cheek, how
flushed it is now."
</p>

<p>
'It was indeed burning with a scarlet, unnatural
flush, quite unlike her own soft, pink colour, which
always reminded one of the petals of a wood
anemone.  Suddenly, as I looked at her, came into
my mind what Mrs. Fortescue had said about the
terrible fever at the jail, and the fear of infection;
and I thought of that poor girl who was just recovering
from it, and to whom Bessie and I had talked so
much at dinner the day before.  Somehow, the very
serious risk that we ran had never struck me until
this moment; but now that I did realize it, a perfect
panic of fear began to overwhelm me.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh Henrietta!" I cried, springing to my feet.
"She is going to have the fever.  I know she is.
Oh poor, poor Bessie!  Perhaps she will die; and
we shall all catch it, and die too.  Oh mamma!  I
must go home to mamma.  I cannot stay in this
horrible place any longer;" and then I clung to
Henrietta's neck, and sobbed in a kind of helpless,
wretched way, feeling utterly unable to stop myself.
</p>

<p>
"'Hush! hush! sweetheart: think of Bessie," she
whispered imploringly.  "And the others too; they
would be so angry if we woke them."
</p>

<p>
'But I was too far gone to control myself; and
seeing this, Henrietta made no further attempt to
check my sobs, but held me in her arms, and let me
smother them on her shoulder.  Bessie still slept on,
in spite of my sudden outburst, and none of our
fellow-prisoners gave any sign of being awake.
</p>

<p>
'"Frances," said Henrietta gently, after a little
while, when I began to be somewhat calmer, "we
must not forget our prayers, must we, though we are
in such a place as this?  Don't you think we might
say them now, while it is all quiet, and there is no
one to interrupt us?"
</p>

<p>
'She spoke with a sort of shyness and hesitation,
as if it was an effort to talk of such a subject even
to me, child as I was, and in the dim light of early
morning.  "If you please," I murmured; and we
knelt and said the Lord's Prayer softly together,
and then part of the Litany: "In all time of our
tribulation, in all time of our wealth, in the hour of
death, and in the day of judgment, good Lord deliver
us!"  It was the first time that I had ever said that
passage with all my heart.
</p>

<p>
'When we had finished, I glanced at Henrietta's
face, and there was something in her eyes, as they
met mine, which made me, with a sudden impulse,
give her such a kiss as I would have given Bessie.
</p>

<p>
'"I think you will not be so unhappy now, will
you, dear Fan?" she said, returning it warmly, and
stroking my hair; and I answered earnestly, "No,
indeed;" for the mere effort of trying to repeat the
well-known words that I had been used to say reverently
night and morning, ever since I could remember,
had soothed my paroxysm of grief and fright, and
reminded me that our Father in Heaven was caring
for us still, and that, under His protection, we might
"dwell safely, and be quiet from fear of evil."
</p>

<p>
'"He will deliver us," murmured Henrietta, "sooner
or later; so we will not frighten ourselves by looking
forward to what may happen.  We will make up our
minds to hope for the best; shall we?  You know
the jailer half promised to give us a room to ourselves
to-day.  Oh, what a boon that would be!"
</p>

<p>
'This hope made me feel quite cheerful; and we
sat talking in under-tones about our letters, and the
possibility of persuading the jailer to forward them,
until the sleepers around us began, one after another,
to awake, roused by the returning sunbeams, which
were now lighting up the room.
</p>

<p>
'It was not until all the rest were up and moving
about&mdash;by no means noiselessly&mdash;that Bessie at last
awoke.  She had continued to sleep heavily&mdash;nothing
seeming to disturb her in the least degree&mdash;until an
old woman, with a particularly shrill, not to say
cracked voice, struck up the old cavalier song of
"The King shall enjoy his own again," which she
elaborated with various trills, turns, and quaverings;
and then at length poor Bessie gave a startled cry and
sprang to her feet, almost before she had opened her
eyes.  She was quite well, she said, except for a little
headache, but it was easy to see that it was by no
means such a little one; and when the breakfast of
somewhat watery porridge and dry bread made its
appearance, she turned away with a shudder, declaring
that she would starve rather than touch a mouthful.
The morning passed away much as the day before had
done.  By Henrietta's wise suggestion we had made
our toilets, as well as we could under the circumstances,
before our companions had roused themselves
enough to take any notice of us; but when Bessie began
to plait her hair, and opened the trunk to take out
our little mirror, a regular crowd was round her in a
minute.  It was just like our poultry-yard at home
when mamma went out with her apron full of corn.
The mirror was very soon taken out of her hands,
and seemed to have but a small chance of returning
to them.  I suppose we must have been the only
people in the room who possessed such a treasure;
for it brought about so much pushing and jostling,
and even fighting, among the women to whom Bessie
had yielded it, that at last it was cracked right across,
after which they became more quarrelsome than ever.
Meanwhile some amused themselves by diving into
our unfortunate little trunk, until every one of its
contents had been pulled out and examined.  One
or two women interfered on our behalf, but this only
made the wrangling worse; and Henrietta and I
looked on in helpless dismay, while Bessie went on
braiding her pretty golden locks in a sort of dull,
indifferent way, as if she felt too languid to care either for
the loss of her mirror, or the ransacking of her chest.
</p>

<p>
'But suddenly, in the midst of the commotion,
there was a sound which silenced all the tongues in a
moment, and made our eyes turn towards the door.
There was a grating of the bolts, and a rattling of the
key in the lock, and yet it was not nearly time for
dinner.  Was it only some new prisoner, or was it a
summons, coming to one of ourselves, to the bar of
the terrible Lord Chief-Justice?  I remember quite
well the intensely painful look of expectation upon
all the faces round the room when the door opened,
and the various murmurs of surprise, relief, and pity
that sounded in our ears when we three were called
upon to follow the turnkey.
</p>

<p>
'"So soon! the latest comers of all!  Ay! well.
May we never see them back again; that's the best
luck I can wish them!"
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, neighbour, there are worse places than this,
evil though it be," said the musical old woman; and
the words made me shiver.
</p>

<p>
'"I wish you well through your troubles, my little
lady," said the girl with whom I had made friends the
day before.  She had been collecting those little
possessions of ours that had been strewn about the floor;
and now she was helping us to arrange the hoods and
mantles, which, by counsel of the turnkey, we were
hastily throwing on.  "I will try and take care of
your goods there," she said, glancing towards the
trunk; and then, as I thanked her, she bent down
and added in a hurried whisper: "I was awake this
morning when you were saying your prayers; it made
me think of my own again.  Tell her" (and she
nodded to Henrietta).  "Fare ye well: and God bless
you all."
</p>

<p>
'I did not shrink from her now as I might have
done an hour ago.  In my present terror I had forgotten
all about the fever; but, ah! how sick at heart
I felt when I heard the door close, and knew that we
were really on our way to a court of justice&mdash;that in
a few minutes more we should be in the presence of
the merciless Judge Jeffreys!  And when we actually
stood in the court itself, and above the hum of many
voices all around us the tones of some one declaiming
in hoarse, fierce accents reached us from an open
doorway, a cold agony of horror came over me, that
was positive pain.  I leaned against Henrietta and
gasped with fright.
</p>

<p>
'"Courage, sweetheart," she whispered.  "Indeed
you have no need for all this fear.  He cannot do
anything so very terrible to you.  If he does say a
few rough words, they will very soon be over.
Surely you are brave enough to bear that.  Think
what much worse things some people have suffered,
and how bravely too!"  Her voice was so steady and
cheerful, and she looked down into my face with such
a bright reassuring smile, that I felt for a moment a
little bit relieved.  What I should have done without
her during those wretched moments of waiting, I
cannot say.  I thought afterwards that I should almost
have died with terror then, if it had not been for the
sense of comfort that it gave me to feel her hand
clasping mine, and her arm round my waist.
</p>

<p>
'Fond as I was of Bessie, I had never had the
same feeling of confidence and protection when I
was with her that Henrietta's presence had begun to
give me.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Bessie!  I had scarcely looked at her since
we left the prison, so much had my fears absorbed
me.  I was not, like Henrietta, strong and brave and
unselfish enough to think of other people in the
midst of our anxiety; and we had been waiting some
time in that crowded ante-room, before I bethought
myself of looking to see how she was faring.  Then,
greatly to my astonishment, I saw that she was
speaking to some one among the throng of prisoners
awaiting their trial, and at the next glance I
recognised her acquaintance as no other than our good old
vicar, Dr. Power.  His face, as he turned to greet us,
looked sadly changed,&mdash;no longer ruddy, and beaming
with mirth and good-humour, but mournful and
haggard, and full ten years older than when we had
seen him last.
</p>

<p>
'"Poor children! poor children!" he muttered.
"It grieves me to the soul to see you here.  A babe
like thee, too.  Shame, shame on them!" he went on,
looking compassionately at my tearful, frightened
face.  "But take courage, little maid.  It can be but
a matter of a few thousand pounds or so, to set you
free again."
</p>

<p>
'"Ay, for her&mdash;for both of them," murmured Bessie.
"But, oh!  Dr. Power, tell me the truth," and she
spoke in a hurried, terrified whisper, grasping his
gown in her earnestness.  "<i>I</i> cannot pay a fine, you
know&mdash;I have only my uncle; and he is gone, no one
knows whither.  What will they do to me?  You
will tell me the truth, won't you?  What will they&mdash;what
can they do?" she repeated piteously, looking
up at him with an imploring, eager, almost wild,
expression in her blue eyes.  There was not much
encouragement to be gathered from his countenance.
</p>

<p>
'"Alack! alack! alack!" he said, looking
intensely distressed.  "My poor child, what can I tell
you?  Faith, I know no more than yourself.  Would
to God I had never had a hand in bringing all this
sorrow upon you.  And now I am powerless, quite
powerless, to help you out of it.  It breaks my
heart!"  He sighed heavily, and stood for some
moments with his eyes fixed upon the ground.  Then,
turning to Bessie suddenly again: "Child," said he,
"I fear I can do nought to help you.  Nay, mayhap
it may rather harm you to be seen conversing with
me now.  So fare ye well.  The only piece of counsel
that I can give you, is to plead for yourself."
</p>

<p>
'"Plead with <i>him</i>?" quoth the jailer under whose
charge we were.  "By your leave, sir, that's no
wise counsel of yours.  Far better tell her to hold her
peace.  What!"&mdash;here he sank his voice to a significant
whisper, and raised his eyebrows expressively&mdash;"you
don't know my Lord Chief-Justice better than
that!"
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, surely even he, ruffian as he is, can scarce
refuse to hear&mdash;&mdash;"  Dr. Power did not finish his
sentence, but laid his hand affectionately on Bessie's
head.  She was looking then as she had looked on
that fatal day when the banner was presented to
Monmouth, only more beautiful.  It struck me even at
that moment, and I understood what Dr. Power
meant.  Fear and excitement had heightened the
colour in her cheek, instead of taking it away,
and added a feverish brightness to her eyes.  I have
never in my life seen any one so lovely as Bessie
looked just then.  Nevertheless the jailer only smiled
a rather compassionate but yet more contemptuous
smile, and shrugged his shoulders.  He evidently had
a very low opinion of Dr. Power's judgment in this
matter.
</p>

<p>
'This unexpected meeting had made me in some
degree forget my qualms; but that space of relief was
only too soon over: and, oh! how my heart sank
again when the moment came at last, and we were
told to follow the jailer into court.  All the former
dread swept over me now stronger than ever.  Dr. Power's
farewell, "God be with you, my children, and
preserve you.  I doubt we shall never meet again!"
hardly reached my ears.  I certainly did not take in
its meaning at the time; though afterwards the words
came back to me with a pang, for the foreboding was
a true one.  I never saw him again.
</p>

<p>
'I clung to Henrietta's waist, and trembled so
violently, that I believe she must have half carried me
into the court.  When I try to recall what was going
on around us, everything seems in a mist until the
moment when I found myself standing at the bar
between Bessie and Henrietta.  If you have set your
hearts upon a vivid description of a court of justice,
and a minute history of all the proceedings that took
place there that morning, I am afraid you will be
disappointed, because I have only an extremely vague
impression of the whole scene.  There was an
immense room, an immense crowd of people; but the
whole crowd&mdash;sheriff, mayor, lawyers, witnesses, and
spectators&mdash;all looked like one hazy vision.  Only
one out of those rows and rows of faces did I see
distinctly apart from the rest; and that was a face not
soon forgotten by those who had once seen it.  No;
it only required a glance at those keen, fierce,
deep-set eyes and scowling brows, and that savage,
repulsive mouth, to enable one to recognise the Lord
Chief-Justice.  I recollect the rough, heavy tones
with which he bawled out a command to "speak
louder" when my name was asked, and I stammered
out a timid, tremulous reply.  His voice alone
half-frightened me out of my wits; and, oh! the oath
which he used, and the epithets which he bestowed on
me and my father! (when at length, with a desperate
effort, I did manage to pronounce my name audibly).
I would not shock your ears by repeating them.  The
next thing I remember is, that some papers were
read, which of course must have been the evidence
taken down by the notary upon the day of our arrest;
and then a string of rapid questions were put to us
that were answered for the most part by Henrietta
and Bessie&mdash;the same questions chiefly that had been
asked us before by Master Noakes.  Then some
witnesses were called up and examined&mdash;some
of Madame St. Aubert's servants, and two men who
seemed to have been friends of Colonel Dare's.  Of
what they all said, I have not the least recollection.
I only remember the blustering insolent way in which
the Lord Chief-Justice from time to time interrupted
them&mdash;sometimes bursting in with a furious oath,
sometimes with a volley of abuse, sometimes with a
horrible jest.  I believe our examination lasted a
very little while in reality&mdash;much less time than we
had stayed waiting in the ante-room; but to me it
seemed hours.
</p>

<p>
'We pleaded guilty to all the charges that were
laid against us, only that Henrietta denied having given
money to Colonel Dare, or having either helped in
the working or presentation of Monmouth's luckless
banner; whereupon she was silenced with a shower
of foul language, that made us ready to sink into the
earth with horror.  When, however, at length we
heard our sentence, the first thought that struck me
was, that it was not such a very terrible one, after all.
An order was given that our fathers or guardians
were to be called upon immediately for the sum of
ten thousand pounds apiece, in fine, for the "high
crime and misdemeanour" of which we confessed
ourselves guilty.  This sum, over and above the
seven thousand pounds which was the ransom for the
rest of Madame St. Aubert's pupils, was the
punishment which our additional piece of treason had
brought down upon our heads.  But "ten thousand
pounds" were simply so many words to me, nothing
more.  I had not the smallest idea of what such a
sum really meant.  In fact, the idea of a hundred
pounds would, in those days, have seemed to me
quite as tremendous.  I thought my father was a
very rich man, and that, though he would doubtless
be somewhat indignant at the demand, it was a
matter of course that he would be able to pay the
ransom.  But Bessie knew the value of money better
than I did.
</p>

<p>
'I heard a smothered cry beside me as Judge
Jeffreys pronounced the sentence; and when, with
scarcely a moment's pause, he signed to the jailer to
remove us, she lingered for a moment, moved a few
steps after us, hesitated again, and the next instant,
while Henrietta and I stood motionless with horror
and dismay, and even the jailer stared in speechless
surprise, she had sprung back again to the bar.  "My
lord&mdash;my lord," she faltered in trembling, eager tones,
"Hear me one moment, just one moment, I pray you,
for the love of God.  I can never pay such a sum of
money.  I have not a penny in the world; and there
is nobody to pay it for me.  Oh my lord, do have
mercy.  My uncle, Sir Geoffrey Davenant&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'The Lord Chief-Justice must have been rather
astonished at her sudden audacity, or he would
hardly have allowed her to go on so long without
interruption; but at this point he broke in with a
rude, derisive roar of laughter.  "Oh ho! so Sir
Geoffrey is your uncle, is he?  My very humble
service to you, mistress.  There, jailer, off with
her! off with her! we have no time for such foolery as
this."
</p>

<p>
'The jailer moved towards her, whispering, "Are
ye mad, mistress?" and tried to lead her from the
bar.  But her spirit was up now; indignation and
despair had made her forget all fear for the moment.
With a glance that was almost fierce, she wrenched
her arm from his grasp, and continued passionately:
</p>

<p>
'"You will not save me?  You will not have pity
on me?  Then, at least, let me say this: if I must
not plead for myself, at least let me plead for that
poor child.  I dragged her into this trouble, I
persuaded her to give money; and for Henrietta Sidney,
who&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Take her away, jailer," thundered Jeffreys,
with a curse and frown that made my heart stand
still&mdash;"unless she wants to pay the ransom that her
uncle paid this morning on Tower Hill."  Then I saw
Bessie turn white as death; and covering her face
with her hood, she passively allowed the jailer to lead
her away.
</p>

<p>
'The instant we had passed the threshold, I burst
into a passion of tears.  As for Bessie, she walked a
few steps mechanically, and then, without a word
or a sign, sank in a fainting fit on to the ground.
</p>

<p>
'As we re-entered the prison, the jailer carrying
Bessie, still unconscious, in his arms, we were met by
the governor.  "Poor maid! poor maid!" he muttered
pitifully, when he had heard the state of the
case.  "But, mercy on us, what a lack of discretion
some people have!  That she should have been so
crazed as to dare to bandy words with the Lord
Chief-Justice!  Marry, what could she expect?  She
was in luck to escape so easily.  Ah! these are
fearful days, indeed."  And he passed on, with an
expressive shake of the head, pausing a moment to say in
something of his old peevish manner: "I've ordered
them to find you a chamber to yourselves.  'Tis
sorely inconvenient, ay, well-nigh impossible to
manage it; but there&mdash;well&mdash;my wife has been urging
me so strongly&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'He finished the sentence with a grunt as he
walked away.  This piece of news was certainly a
drop of comfort in our cup of misfortune.  It was
such a relief to find ourselves at last alone.  Though
our room was dismal and comfortless enough, to be
sure, still it was luxurious compared to the horrible
place we had left two hours ago.  Yes&mdash;only two
hours ago, after all; but the very longest two
hours that I ever remember in the whole course
of my life.  Ah! may you never know what it
is to pass two such hours as those were!
</p>

<p>
'The turnkey left us, promising to send his wife
with some strong waters, which he said would
"bring the young mistress back to life again in a
twinkling."  He had laid Bessie gently down on the
one straw mattress which the little room contained;
and Henrietta knelt by her side, doing everything
that she could think of to bring her to herself.  I
stood by, meanwhile, awe-stricken and bewildered, for
I had never seen any one in a swoon before; and as
the moments passed on, and she did not move or
breathe, I began to fancy that she was dead, and that
Henrietta was trying to hide it from me.  At length,
when the turnkey's wife came in with the "strong
waters," and rubbed her temples, and poured a
spoonful down her throat, Bessie did begin to show
some signs of life.  A tinge of colour came back to
her cheeks, and she half-opened her eyes.  But they
had a strange, vacant look; and when I sprang
towards her with an exclamation of joy, she gave an
odd, frightened stare, as if she did not know me,
and then broke out into a wild fit of laughter.
</p>

<p>
'It was in vain that Henrietta kissed her, and
spoke to her quietly, and soothingly assured her that
there was nothing now to fear, and that I tried to
make her understand where we were: she took
not the slightest notice of us, but only gazed at
everything with the same blank, unnatural stare.
</p>

<p>
'"What is the matter with her?  What shall we
do?" I whispered, shrinking in dismay from her side.
</p>

<p>
'"Hush!" she whispered, and stood silently watching
with intense interest the countenance of the
turnkey's wife.
</p>

<p>
'The woman bent over the mattress, and, with her
hand on Bessie's wrist, scrutinized her earnestly for a
few minutes.  Then, as she looked, her face changed
and, turning to Henrietta, she said gravely: "This is
somewhat more than a swoon, mistress.  Look at her
eyes, and feel her hands too&mdash;how cold and clammy!
Dear heart!  I fear she is very sick.  Belike she is
going to have the fever, poor lamb!"
</p>

<p>
'"The fever?" repeated Henrietta faintly.
</p>

<p>
'"Ay, mistress, it's been raging here of late; and
there were some down with it in that room where
you've been not very long since.  Oh! it's been terrible
bad in this place.  I've lost two children by it,
and I had a touch of it myself."
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta and I exchanged terrified glances.  The
remembrance of our conversation that morning was
in the minds of both of us.
</p>

<p>
'"Ay, mistress, 'tis the sickness, I misdoubt me,"
said the turnkey's wife again, when Henrietta told
her of Bessie's restless, feverish night, and her
unnatural languor and depression in the morning.
"'Tis always so with them when it begins.  She was
sickening for the fever all day, poor dear lady,
depend upon it; and now this fright coming upon it,
has driven the poor thing clean out of her wits.
'Twill be more than a miracle if it doesn't go hard
with her.  Ah! well-a-day, she won't be the first
by a long way, whom that stony-hearted,
blood-thirsty&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh don't, pray don't talk so," implored Henrietta
in a tone of distraction.  "Only tell me what to do!
Only bring her a physician.  I will pay you anything
you ask, if you will bring a physician to her."
</p>

<p>
'The woman shook her head doubtfully.  She
would see if it could be managed, she said; but it
was for the governor to give permission.  She durst
do nothing without his orders, and he had just now
gone into court as witness in one of the trials that
were taking place; and then (she said), "Mayhap he
will dine at his lordship's table.  But there, lack-a-day,"
she concluded, "a physician could do but little
for her now.  The disease must have its course, you
see, mistress; besides, it misgives me&mdash;it does
indeed, ladies&mdash;that it will go hard with her, poor
dear!"
</p>

<p>
'The turnkey's wife was evidently not given to
looking on the bright side of things, but she seemed
kind-hearted, in her way, notwithstanding; and she
left the room, promising to do what she could about
a doctor directly the governor was forthcoming.
</p>

<p>
'For some moments Henrietta and I could only
stand looking at one another in mute dismay.  It
gave one such a miserable, helpless feeling to hear
the dreadful fever was already with us&mdash;that Bessie
was dangerously ill, and that we were absolutely
powerless to help her.  Neither of us knew what
ought to be done.  Doctors, medicine, proper food,
none were to be had.  Even the simplest comforts,
that she had never before been without, were now
hopelessly out of our reach.  We could do nothing
but make up the straw bed as well as we could with
some of the contents of our baggage, which we had
found in a tolerable state of preservation, lying in a
corner of our new room.  Strange to say, nothing
was missing but the looking-glass.  The poor girl
had kept her word when she promised to do her best
to take care of our goods.  So we made up a pillow
for Bessie, and threw over her everything in the way
of covering that we could find, and then sat down,
with heavy hearts, to watch by her side.  She had
sunk back into a perfectly unconscious state, looking
as deadly white as she had been before she was
aroused from her long swoon.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, if Mrs. Fortescue were but here!" cried
Henrietta, wringing her hands in despair.  "If there
was anything that we could do for her!  But there is
nothing&mdash;nothing at all&mdash;only to sit still helplessly,
while she is perhaps dying under our very eyes.
Frances, it is too horrible!" and for the first time
since I had known her, I saw Henrietta cry.
</p>

<p>
'I had never before heard her speak so strongly
and passionately&mdash;never imagined how intense her
feelings were; and now the bitter grief in her voice,
and the violent, uncontrolled way in which she wept,
quite frightened me.  I could only lean my head
against her shoulder, and cry too; and in this
disconsolate way we sat till the turnkey appeared with
dinner.  He brought us a message from his wife, to
the effect that the governor would not return until
late in the evening; but that she would come again
herself, and bring a drink for the sick lady.  Once
more Henrietta entreated that a doctor might be
brought, but once more in vain.  Even when she
offered every gold piece that her purse contained, the
turnkey was obstinate still.
</p>

<p>
'"Not without the governor's authority," he
persisted.  "These were times when one must do
nought rashly, if one meant one's head to stay on
one's shoulders."
</p>

<p>
'Well, the hours went on dismally and wearily.
Poor Bessie woke from her lethargy after a while, but
in a state that shocked and frightened us more than
ever.  She tossed incessantly from side to side, with
burning cheeks and parched lips&mdash;her blue eyes wide
open, and brilliant with fever.  Oh! what misery it
was to sit and listen to her as she lay talking wildly
and incoherently on all sorts of subjects&mdash;sometimes
about Madame St. Aubert, and Pauline, and her old
school occupations; at others, raving violently about
Colonel Dare and the Duke of Monmouth.  Then
she would fancy herself again at the bar pleading
before Judge Jeffreys, and implore piteously for
mercy on her uncle.  But, oh! the worst of all
was when she started up and clung to Henrietta,
screaming in an agony of fear that Judge Jeffreys
was going to send her to the scaffold.  The turnkey's
wife came again in the afternoon with the promised
draught; and whether it was the effect of that,
or that she was at last thoroughly exhausted, I do
not know, but she suddenly became quieter, and at
length sank once more into a state of stupor.  Thus
the day wore on, and at last night came, and the
turnkey's wife looked in to pay us a farewell visit,
bringing another draught for Bessie, and a candle.
She looked at the motionless figure on the mattress,
with sincere pity in her face, and then shook her head
despondingly.
</p>

<p>
'"You do not think her better?" asked Henrietta
with a quivering voice.
</p>

<p>
'"She'll not be here in the morning," the woman
answered gravely, after a moment's hesitation.  "I
wish I could stay with you to-night, mistress; but I've
a sick babe to nurse myself."  And with another
wistful, compassionate glance towards the mattress,
she bade us good night and closed the door.
</p>

<p>
'The next minute the silence that followed was
broken by Bessie herself.
</p>

<p>
'"Henrietta, what time is it?"
</p>

<p>
'She spoke quite calmly and naturally, though her
voice was very faint.  A glance at her face showed
that the delirium had passed away; but there was a
curious expression in her eyes that I had never seen
before.  The wild, vacant look was gone, but they
were still strangely bright; and there was something
so deep and solemn, and at the same time so very
sad and yearning, in the gaze which she turned upon
me as I went to her side, that I almost shrank from
her.
</p>

<p>
'"What o'clock is it?" she repeated, with an effort
to raise her voice.
</p>

<p>
'"About nine, my love," Henrietta replied
tremulously.  "How do you feel, dear Bessie?  You are
better, I think, are you not?"
</p>

<p>
'Bessie made no answer.  She only closed her eyes
again, and leaned her cheek against Henrietta's hand.
At length she opened them again, and said abruptly:
</p>

<p>
'"I heard what she said, Henrietta.  She was quite
right.  I shall not be here in the morning."
</p>

<p>
'A thrill ran through me as she said this.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh don't, Bessie&mdash;don't speak so!  You are,
better now&mdash;indeed you are!  You will get well,
and my father and Henrietta's will pay."  Here I broke
off suddenly, checked by a warning glance from
Henrietta, and buried my face in the pillow to choke
back the rising sobs.
</p>

<p>
'"No, Frances, dear, I am not better," said Bessie,
still in the same calm, steady tone; "and I don't
think I want to get better.  It is all coming back
to me now.  I remember what he said about my
uncle.  Was that very long ago, Henrietta?"
</p>

<p>
'"Only this morning, my dear."
</p>

<p>
'"Only this morning!  And I feel as if it was
all so very, very long ago.  It seems like a dream&mdash;a
dreadful, horrible dream.  Ah! I thought I was going
to die when he looked at me like that."  She gave a
sort of gasp and shudder, and clung more closely to
Henrietta's hand.  "I don't want to think of his face
now, Henrietta.  Do help me," she said plaintively.
"Won't you read to me, and say some prayers?"
</p>

FOR A MOMENT SHE KNELT IN SILENCE, HER EYES <br>
FIXED ON THE PAGE.
</p>

<p>
'Without speaking, Henrietta took out her prayer-book,
and found the Service for the Communion of
the Sick.  Her strong self-command was almost
giving way then.  For a moment she knelt in silence,
her eyes fixed on the page, and her lip quivering;
but when her voice came, it was clear and firm, as if
we had been at evening prayers in Madame St. Aubert's
schoolroom.
</p>

<p>
'For some minutes after Henrietta had closed the
book, Bessie lay quite still, with her eyes shut, and I
thought at first that she had fallen asleep; but
presently she looked up and said, with a faint sigh:
</p>

<p>
'"Henrietta, I never knew what you were before.
It was my fault if we were not good friends in the
old days.  Will you forgive all those thoughtless
words and taunts of mine?"
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta's answer was a long, fervent kiss.
</p>

<p>
'"You were right, too, when you said we should
bring trouble upon ourselves," Bessie went on
mournfully; "but I could not help it.  I do not
know that I could do anything else, if all should come
over again.  I thought I was doing right.  My uncle
loved the Duke.  Only poor little Frances&mdash;She
must forgive me too.  I feel as if I was a good deal to
blame for her part in this matter.'"
</p>

<p>
'"No, no, dear Bessie," I sobbed, flinging myself
down by her side.  "It was not your fault.  Henrietta
did nothing, and you know she has been punished as
much as we have."
</p>

<p>
'"Dear little Fan, good-bye."
</p>

<p>
'These words were very faintly and wearily spoken;
then her eyes closed again, and Henrietta, signing
to me not to disturb her, drew me gently away from
the bed.  I made no remonstrance when she arranged
some cloaks at the other end of the room, and begged
me to lie down and try to sleep.  All the afternoon
I had felt tired and drowsy, and as if a heavy weight
was pressing down my eyes.  Now my head was
aching painfully, my throat felt terribly parched
and sore, and I lay down and sobbed on drearily,
while Henrietta made me as comfortable as she
could, and then went to keep watch by Bessie's
side.
</p>

<p>
'"Perhaps she will be better to-morrow, if she
goes to sleep," I murmured dreamily.  But Henrietta's
only answer was a silent kiss; and that is the last
I remember of that weary night.
</p>

<p>
'It was broad daylight when I next opened my
eyes.  Henrietta was standing over me with a white
worn face, and eyelids red and swollen with tears.
I just recollect noticing this, and also vaguely
wondering where Bessie was, for she was not lying
on the mattress now; and when I raised my head,
and tried to look round the room, there seemed
no one there but Henrietta and myself.  But I did
not ask her any questions, and I made no reply when
she spoke to me.  In fact, her words did not seem
to reach my senses, I felt far too ill and wretched
to care for anything, except to be left alone.  I
certainly was conscious of an intense desire for that.
It was agony to move my head, and my throat
was so much swollen, and so painful, that I could
scarcely breathe, much less speak.  Certain hazy
recollections I have of the turnkey's wife lifting me
up, and pouring something down my throat.  Then
comes a long blank in my memory&mdash;that is, not quite
a blank, for I have a confused remembrance of long
restless nights and constant thirst, and horrible
nightmare feelings, one of which was, that mamma
perpetually appeared, bringing me a cup of cider, but that
directly I tried to take it from her hand, she
invariably dashed it to the ground.  I woke up in my
sound senses again.  I heard Henrietta talking to
somebody.
</p>

<p>
'"She will never get well here.  The doctor told
me so this morning.  He says she must have pure air
and wholesome, nourishing food; that nothing else
can save her.  Oh! what shall I do?"
</p>

<p>
'"Ah, poor little heart," said the voice of the
turnkey's wife; "she is sorely changed, to be sure.  She
don't look as if you'd keep her here much longer.
Well-a-day!  My heart aches for her mother, poor
lady; and they say her father's well-nigh ruined with
gambling, and that's why he can't pay the fine."
</p>

<p>
'"And you sent the letter?  You are certain that it
went by a sure hand?" Henrietta asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, yes, mistress, the letter's gone safe enough.
But I've heard tell that they'll never let her come
here till the money's paid; and sure she'll fret sadly
to think how the poor child's lying sick and calling
for her."
</p>

<p>
'"Henrietta," I said, when I heard the woman
leave the room, "have you been writing to mamma?"
</p>

<p>
'She was looking down at me with a perplexed,
pained countenance, but my words made it light up
with a bright gleam of joy.
</p>

<p>
'"Frances, my darling, are you better?  How glad
I am to hear you speak like yourself again!"
</p>

<p>
'"Have I been very ill, Henrietta?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, dear, very ill indeed; but you are going to
get better now, I hope."
</p>

<p>
'"I don't know.  I thought you said&mdash;didn't you
say something about a doctor?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, sweetheart; the governor sent you a doctor.
He is coming again to-day."
</p>

<p>
'"And have I been very long ill?"
</p>

<p>
'"Only three days."
</p>

<p>
'"Only three days! but everything seems so long
ago!"
</p>

<p>
'Even as I spoke, I remembered how Bessie had
used the very same words; and I tried to raise
myself on my elbow and look round, but I was much
too weak to make the slightest movement without
Henrietta's arm.
</p>

<p>
'"Where is Bessie?" I whispered.
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta's face changed, and she hesitated, as if
doubtful what answer to give me; and, with a sudden
pang, the thought came back to me of that night when
I had cried myself to sleep, and that morning when,
looking at the mattress where Bessie had been lying,
I saw that she was no longer there.  So I did not ask
again, but passively swallowed the medicine that
Henrietta brought me, and lay for a long time in
silence, with my aching head in her lap.  Then at
length I repeated my first question, "Have you been
writing to mamma?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, sweetheart; I wrote a long letter, and told
her everything&mdash;how ill you were, and how much you
wanted her.  You kept imploring her to come all
through last night."
</p>

<p>
'"Did I?  Ah, I have been dreaming about her
so much!  Henrietta, did the doctor say that I should
not get well?"
</p>

<p>
'"He thought you very ill, my dear; but you are
so much better this morning, that I hope he will say
that you are getting quite well now."
</p>

<p>
'"If mamma would but come!" I murmured.
"I think I should get well if I could only have
mamma."
</p>

<p>
'"Poor child!" said Henrietta, with a sigh.  "I
know that I cannot nurse you as well as she would.
But she will come, Fan, when my letter reaches her.
I am sure she will.  And now, my dear child, you
have talked too much already.  You must lie still
and rest now, and try to go to sleep."
</p>

<p>
'I was thinking of those words of the turnkey's
wife, about my father being ruined, and not being
able to pay the ransom; but I did not feel equal to
the effort of asking Henrietta whether there was any
truth in them, for I was very weary, and ill, and
languid, and so weak that I could not even lift my arm.
One thing more, however, I wanted to ask, before I
followed her advice.  "Henrietta, did you ever hear
whether our letters were sent,&mdash;those letters that we
wrote, you know, that first day?"
</p>

<p>
'"I do not know, but I fear not; for although I did
ask the turnkey about them once, he would not give
me a direct answer, and he looked so grim that I was
afraid to say anything more."
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta did not tell me then that her ransom was
already paid, and that the order for her release had
been made out that very morning.
</p>

<p>
'It was not until some time afterwards that I found
out how much I had to thank her for: how she had
nursed me through those three days when I was lying
between life and death, as untiringly and devotedly
as if she had been mamma herself; nor how, when
she might have left the jail the moment the order
of release was signed, she had chosen instead to stay
with me in the pestilential atmosphere of that
wretched, comfortless little room, utterly refusing to
leave me until my mother should come to take her
place.  But, as I said before, all this had not dawned
upon me as yet.  Besides, I felt that no one, however
kind, could be quite the same as mamma when one
was ill; so I am afraid I must have seemed very
ungrateful to poor Henrietta, when I murmured
fretfully, "Oh dear! oh dear! why doesn't my mother
come?  No one can nurse me as well as she can.
I am sure I shall die if she won't come soon.  Oh,
mamma, mamma, I do want you so <i>very</i> much!"  Then,
with Henrietta's soothing words, and sweet low
tones sounding in my ears, I sank exhausted into a
long, deep sleep.'

CHAPTER V.
<br><br>
BLUE-COAT'S STORY.
</h3>

<p>
'Surely that isn't the end?' said a
disappointed voice, as Uncle Algernon paused,
and gazed thoughtfully at the portrait of
Lady Greensleeves, which was leaning
against the wall, opposite his writing-table.
</p>

<p>
'That is all I know of Lady Greensleeves' story,' he
replied, with a smile; 'but doubtless Blue-coat has
something to tell.  You must wait till I have had a
confabulation with him, though.'
</p>

<p>
'When will that be?' cried Robin.  'I do want so
to hear his story!  You see boys are so much more
interesting than girls.'
</p>

<p>
Uncle Algernon laughed, and asked Silvia what
she thought; but Silvia was so much affected by the
story, that she was unable to give a coherent answer,
and being, moreover, much ashamed of her tears,
she made rather a sudden exit, leaving Robin to
extract a promise from Uncle Algernon that Bluecoat's
story would be forthcoming at four o'clock on
the morrow.
</p>

<p>
The children were punctual next day&mdash;so punctual,
that they had to wait full five minutes before Uncle
Algernon could finish what he was writing, add
another sheet to the pile of manuscript in his desk,
wheel his chair round to the fire, and begin.
</p>

<p><br></p>

<p class="t3">
BLUE-COAT'S STORY.
</p>

<p>
'I was out on the Palace bowling-green one
afternoon, with some of my companions, most of them
boys of my own age, and fellow-pages of mine.  It
was just after dinner, and almost the only time in the
day when we were free to amuse ourselves exactly as
we pleased; for though the life of a Court page was
idle and profitless enough, perhaps worse than profitless,
it was not all pleasure&mdash;not one continual holiday,
as I had fancied it in the old days at Newcourt.
I had to attend constantly upon the Queen, my
mistress, at breakfast, dinner, and supper.  When
she rode, when she walked in the garden, or in
St. James's Park, I was almost always obliged to follow
her; and when she went out in her coach, I formed
one of the escort on horseback.  Then, in the
evening, there was dancing, or sometimes a masque,
in both of which I was often expected to take part;
and this I rather liked than otherwise&mdash;the acting
especially.  But still the perpetual restraint and
stiffness of Court etiquette, from morning to night,
were very wearisome to me, and you cannot
imagine how much I enjoyed the short time that
I could really call my own, when I could put out
my whole strength, hallo as loud as I chose, and use
my legs and arms according to my own free will.
Perhaps the part of my duties which I most hated
was the standing about in the ante-room to the
Queen's presence-chamber every morning, to receive
letters and petitions, or deliver messages, or usher in
people who came to wait on Her Majesty.  Well, on
the afternoon referred to, I was rejoicing in the
thought of the tiresome business of the morning
being over, and, preparing to enjoy myself thoroughly,
I threw off my coat, and caught up a ball, when I
heard the voice of one of the lacqueys calling for
"My Lord Desmond."
</p>

<p>
'"Who wants me?" I cried impatiently; for the
interruption was most vexatious when one had so
very little time to spare.
</p>

<p>
'"There is a lady in the ante-chamber asking for
you, my lord.  She prays to see you immediately on
very urgent business."
</p>

<p>
'A lady wanting me, and on very urgent business!
This was strange.  Could it be Lady Mountfort? I
thought; and my spirits sank at the idea.  But
when I suggested this in an undertone to Hal Verney,
my chief friend among the pages, he only laughed,
and vowed that when I died the words "Lady
Mountfort" would be found graven on my heart, as
"Calais" was on that of Queen Mary.
</p>

<p>
"Far more likely," he said, "that it is only some
one with a petition to the Queen for grace to some of
the rebels.  There have been so many here lately
seeking pardons for their friends."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh! 'tis that, depend on it," said another.
"Only it seems strange that they should have
admitted her at this hour."
</p>

<p>
'"Well, whoever it may be, make haste to come
back," called out Hal, as I walked reluctantly off to see
this mysterious visitor of mine.
</p>

<p>
'"Did she give no name?" I asked of the lacquey.
</p>

<p>
'"No.  She had refused to give any name," the
man said.  He could only tell me that she seemed of
middle age, but that her face was so concealed by
hood and muffler that not a glimpse of it was to be
seen.  I felt no good will towards her as I made my
way through the noisy group of pages, gentlemen-ushers,
Roman Catholic priests, and Protestant chaplains,
that filled the doorway of the Queen's ante-chamber.
Nevertheless it was with decided relief
that I glanced at the tall, stately figure, standing in a
corner of the room, which was pointed out to me as
the lady.  She was not Lady Mountfort, that was
quite clear, in spite of the veil and muffler; so I was
able to bow, and ask what her commands might be,
with all the ease and self-possession I had learnt of
late, and which would have been quite impossible to
me six months before.
</p>

<p>
'"Can Lord Desmond let me have a few words
with him in private?" she said in a very low and
rather tremulous tone.
</p>

<p>
'But though she spoke almost in a whisper, I knew
the voice directly.  It was that of my mother-in-law,
Lady Dalrymple.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh! find some place where I can speak with
you alone," she repeated earnestly, as I looked round
the room, considering where I should take her.
"There is something that I must say to you&mdash;something
that may be a matter of life or death."
</p>

<p>
'These words fairly startled me, and drove the
game of bowls completely out of my head.  Without
any more hesitation, I pushed open a side door, close
to where we were standing, and led the way to the
Queen's private oratory, which I knew at that hour
we were likely to have to ourselves.  Lady Dalrymple
threw back her veil as I shut the door of the little
chapel, and held out both hands to me.  She looked
much older and thinner than when I had last seen her
on my wedding day; and the kind, bright, cheerful
face, of which I still kept such a pleasant recollection,
had a look of melancholy which I had never seen
there before.
</p>

<p>
'"Algernon," she began hurriedly, "you have not
forgotten your little wife, my poor little daughter
Frances, whom you promised to love and cherish and
protect.  Well, she is in trouble now, as you must
know&mdash;in very great trouble and danger&mdash;and I have
come to ask you to help her."
</p>

<p>
'"But, madam," I stammered, astonished and
bewildered, "how&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Algernon, you are bound to help her.  You
cannot refuse," she interrupted, almost fiercely.
</p>

<p>
'"But indeed I am ready, madam.  I will help her
with all my heart, if you will only tell me what I am
to do."
</p>

<p>
'"I want you to petition the Queen for her,"
continued Lady Dalrymple, trying to control herself and
speak calmly.  "She will listen to you.  She cannot
deny a husband pleading for his wife.  Can she?"  And
Lady Dalrymple laid her hand on my shoulder,
and looked at me for a moment, with an expression
in her eyes as if she was not quite sure whether she
meant to laugh or cry.  It reminded me of the smile
with which she had greeted me that night when Sir
Harry first presented me to her at Horsemandown;
only it was so much sadder, that a vague terror rushed
into my mind.
</p>

<p>
'"Where is Frances?" I asked abruptly.  "And
why is she in trouble?"
</p>

<p>
'"What!  Is it really possible that you have not heard
of the Taunton maidens?" cried Lady Dalrymple.
"Why, theirs is one of the most cruel cases in all this
wicked, horrible business.  Of all the unjust sentences
that Judge Jeffreys has passed during these terrible
assizes, this is surely the most shameful of all.  'Where
is Frances?' do you say, child?  She is in prison&mdash;in
the common jail&mdash;in company with criminals and
outcasts.  She and two of her schoolfellows were sent
there.  Yes, Judge Jeffreys had actually the heart to
shut up three young girls in a place like that, where
a fever is raging too.  One of the poor children is
dead already, and my poor little Fan will die too if
she is not taken away from that terrible place.  She
is very, very sick, and they will not let me go to her."
</p>

<p>
'Poor Lady Dalrymple!  There was such a tone
of misery in her voice, that I felt at that moment as
if I would have done anything in the world for her.
And, besides, I had a strong feeling of pity for my
poor little bride, for her own sake.  I had not thought
much about her, it is true, since the day of our
wedding.  We had been very good friends then, and I had
considered her a pretty little girl, and merry and
good-humoured enough.  Still, she certainly did think
great things of herself&mdash;there was no doubt about
that&mdash;and generally managed to make her brothers
give way to her.  This I very soon found out; and,
happening to have an equally good opinion of myself,
and a most decided liking for my own way, of course
these qualities did not raise her in my estimation.  I
did not at all care for girls, excepting only Agnes, who
was just like my sister, and always did whatever
I told her.  Nevertheless, I was sorry for Frances
from the bottom of my heart.  I tried to fancy her
shut up in a gloomy jail, ill with fever, with no one to
nurse her, and perhaps nothing to eat or drink: she
whom I had last seen with bright eyes and rosy cheeks,
so fearless and high-spirited, and leading what I
thought must be such a happy life at that charming old
place Horsemandown, with her brothers, her dogs, and
her ponies for companions!  When I thought of this,
the blood rushed to my cheeks with indignation at
Judge Jeffreys' cruelty, and for a moment I felt almost
choked, and as if I could not speak to ask how she
had come to be in his power at all.  Then Lady
Dalrymple went on to tell me how Madame St. Aubert,
Sir Harry's kinswoman, under whose care
Agnes Blount and my wife had been placed at Taunton,
had brought the King's severe displeasure upon
herself and all her pupils, by leading them in
procession to present a Bible and a banner to the Duke of
Monmouth.  All the details of the story which Lady
Dalrymple told me, as far as she knew, you have
already heard from Frances herself, so I will not
repeat them.
</p>

<p>
"The affair of the Taunton maids," as it was
called at Court, had been talked about for a day and
then forgotten, or thrown into the background by
other incidents of the Rebellion.  Perhaps, as Lady
Dalrymple hinted in the bitterness of her wrath and
anxiety, there were some who had their reasons for
hushing it up as soon as possible.  But however this
might be, it had somehow never entered my head to
connect the "affair of the Taunton maids" with my
little bride Frances, and Agnes Blount.  No names
had been mentioned; and fining and imprisonment
seemed but a slight penalty when one heard of so
many unfortunate people sentenced to be beheaded,
hung, or transported; to say nothing of the chief
victim of all, the Duke of Monmouth himself, whose
fate created more interest and excitement at Court
than that of all the rest put together.
</p>

<p>
'"But, madam," I asked timidly (for I always
felt a little afraid of people in any great trouble),
"will not Frances be set free directly the fine is
paid?"
</p>

<p>
'"My good child, if she waits till then, she will
never be set free.  The fine they ask is shamefully
extravagant for all the children, but for those three
girls it is even more than that.  It is an enormous
ransom&mdash;a sum that is quite out of our power to
pay."
</p>

<p>
'"But," I persisted, in astonishment, "I thought
Sir Bernard was so very rich!"
</p>

<p>
'"Why should you think so?" demanded Lady
Dalrymple, with a slight sharpness in her tone.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, because&mdash;&mdash;  It was only something that
Agnes heard Father Freeling say at Newcourt."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah, well!"&mdash;and poor Lady Dalrymple sighed
heavily&mdash;"perhaps Father Freeling was right once
upon a time; but those days are over now.  Sir
Bernard has been very unfortunate; and as to this
sum of money, Mr. Sidney may be able to pay it for
his daughter, and, rich as he is, it will take half his
fortune, but we cannot do it.  Were we even to ruin
ourselves and our other children, we could not do it;
and my poor Frances must be saved some other way,
unless she is to stay and die in that den of thieves."
</p>

<p>
'"She shall be saved!" I said to myself resolutely,
and then stood pondering in silence on what the next
step should be.  "Madam," said I, a new idea striking
me, "why should not I pay the ransom?  If she
is my wife, I have a right to do it more than any one
else.  Oh, surely Sir Harry could not have any
objection!  And if enough could not be had without,
we might sell some of the land."
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, that is out of the question," she said,
interrupting me with a melancholy smile.  "My dear boy,
I trust that you will help me to save her, but it
cannot be done in that way.  My husband has appealed
to Sir Harry already, but he can do nothing.  He
cannot touch your money; and if he could, he would
have no right to do so.  You are under age.  We
have no right to ruin you even for her sake.  No; my
only hope now is to petition the Queen."
</p>

<p>
'"Then I pray you, madam, let me take you to the
Queen.  You would know what to say so much
better than I should."
</p>

<p>
'But Lady Dalrymple shook her head very
decidedly at this proposition.  "No, Algernon, believe me,
you would have a much better chance of success than
I should.  So many parents have pleaded in vain
already.  But she is your wife, and&mdash;so young as you
both are&mdash;&mdash;  Yes, indeed, I am sure it is far better that
you should go."
</p>

<p>
'"Then I will go at once," I exclaimed impetuously,
and should have acted on my words if Lady Dalrymple
bad not caught my arm.
</p>

<p>
'"Gently, gently, my good Algernon; wait a bit.
Where is her Majesty now?"
</p>

<p>
'"In her closet with the Princess Anne."
</p>

<p>
'"And is it usual to disturb her at this time?"
</p>

<p>
'I was obliged to admit that it was very unusual
indeed, there being a sort of general order that at
this time the Queen was to be molested on no
pretext whatever, unless it were for some
exceptionally weighty matter.  And to-day the rule was
more stringent than usual, as Her Majesty was
closeted with the Princess Anne.
</p>

<p>
'"Then you must not go now.  You must wait for
a more convenient season.  Algernon, I implore you
not to be hasty.  Everything depends upon speaking
at the right moment."
</p>

<p>
'I saw the force of this counsel plainly enough,
though had I been left to myself, I doubt if it would
ever have struck me; for I was rather given to set
about things in a blundering way, just at the moment
when they came into my head.
</p>

<p>
'"When shall you next see the Queen?" asked
Lady Dalrymple.
</p>

<p>
'"This afternoon, madam, she will walk in the
gardens, or, mayhap, go on the river, and either way
I shall attend her."
</p>

<p>
'"Then you will doubtless find some happy
opportunity for your petition.  I trust to you to
choose your time wisely, and to make yourself heard.
Now I must not stay longer.  See, this is where
I am lodging;" and she handed me a paper.  "If
you succeed, it will be easy enough to send me
tidings."
</p>

<p>
'"But, madam, pray stay one moment.  What
must I say?"
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, child, choose your own words.  Tell her
Majesty the plain facts just as I told you; and
surely, if she has a heart at all, they will be enough
for her.  Farewell!  Be wary.  But, for God's sake,
be as speedy as you prudently can."
</p>

<p>
'Lady Dalrymple turned to leave the oratory; and
as I moved to open the door, it was pushed back by
some one outside, and Lady Sarah Buckthorne, one of
the maids of honour to the Queen, came in for a few
steps, and then stopped short with a look of astonished
inquiry.
</p>

<p>
'"I was called in from&mdash;&mdash;  This lady wished&mdash;&mdash;"
I began, somewhat confused.
</p>

<p>
'"I must beg pardon for intruding here," said
Lady Dalrymple courteously; "but I had occasion
for a few words with my kinsman, Lord Desmond,
and as the ante-chamber was crowded and noisy, he
brought me here for privacy."
</p>

<p>
'Lady Sarah made a stiff courtesy, took up a
breviary that lay on the Queen's prie-dieu, and
departed.
</p>

<p>
'"Is that one of the Queen's ladies?" asked Lady
Dalrymple sharply; and when I told her, there was a
look in her eyes for a moment that was almost fierce.
"If they only understood&mdash;&mdash;!  If they could know
but for one minute&mdash;&mdash;!" I heard her murmur as we
passed through the passage that led to the
ante-chamber.
</p>

<p>
'When I got back to the bowling-green, a game
was going on, in which everybody seemed too deeply
interested to notice my reappearance.  I was rather
glad of this, for I was in no humour to play; so I
stood looking on absently, while I pondered in my
own mind what I should say to the Queen.  Presently
Hal Verney came up to rouse me with a slap on the
shoulder, and asked why I was in the dumps, and
who it was that had sent for me.
</p>

<p>
'"You see you were such an unconscionable time
gone," he continued, "that you could not expect one
to wait for you.  But this game is almost over, and
then we'll have a glorious match; so cheer up, man,
and don't be moody."
</p>

<p>
'I gave Hal to understand that he had hit upon
quite a wrong explanation of my moodiness, and that
my interest in bowls for that morning was over.
Whereupon he became so curious, that I ended by
telling him all.  Hal was such a quick, sharp-witted
fellow, that I thought it very likely he might be of
some use to me in managing my suit to the Queen.
I had scarcely ever spoken of Frances to Hal
before&mdash;partly because, I am sorry to say, she was so very
seldom in my thoughts, and partly because, when I
first came to Court, it had been the fashion with him
and the others to consider my very early marriage as
an excellent joke, and to pity me for being tied to a
wife already.  However, even if that jest had not
been worn out long ago, there was far too much
chivalry in Hal for him to dream of alluding to it
now.  He listened with more interest than I had
expected, and was quite as vehement in his indignation
against the Lord Chief-Justice as I was myself.
'"You had better say nothing to the others about
what you are going to do," was his first bit of counsel.
"It is as well that it should not be noised all over
the Palace before you make your petition.  Why,
Algernon, you must have heard all about the
Taunton girls and that Madame St. Aubert before?
'Tis a marvel that you should never have thought of
your wife being among them!"  I could not but own
that I had been extremely dull.  "And then," Hal
proceeded, "I daresay you never noticed how, one
day, when Princess Anne asked what had become of
them, Lady Sarah managed to turn the conversation,
and prevent any one from answering her.  Ah, well,
if you had kept your eyes open, as I do, you would
know something of these matters."  I looked at Hal
with intense respect.  He certainly had a wonderful
talent for keeping his eyes open, and finding out all
the little intrigues that were going on in every quarter
of the Palace.  "Do you know," he went on, in very
low and mysterious tones, "that the Queen's ladies
have contrived to get the fines for those girls
granted to them to divide among themselves?  Isn't
it a shamefully mean and pitiful thing to do?
It was through Philip Buckthorne that I found it
out."
</p>

<p>
'"The maids of honour!" repeated I in dismay.
"Then there is no chance of the Queen's showing any
grace to me!"
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, don't be too sure of that," said Hal
sagaciously.  "Depend upon it the Queen knows mighty
little about the matter; and however that may be, it
is not at all unlikely that she may grant a pardon to
this one particular girl, when she hears who she is,
and all about her."
</p>

<p>
'"I wish Lady Dalrymple would have agreed to ask
an audience of the Queen herself," I sighed despondingly.
</p>

<p>
"She had too much wit to do that," pronounced Hal
with a significant smile.  "Don't you know that Sir
Bernard Dalrymple is not in the King's good graces?
Ah, you were not here in King Charles's time, so you
don't know, of course.  You see, he used to be in high
favour with King Charles, but the Duke of York never
liked him.  Why, since the coronation, Sir Bernard
has never been seen at Court.  Then, besides, he lost
tremendously at the gaming-tables&mdash;more than half
his fortune, they say.  And he is in debt.  Oh, there
is scarcely a soul in the Palace that he does not owe
money to."  I was quite aghast at this piece of
information.  It accounted for Lady Dalrymple's refusal
to give her name, and her evident wish not to make
herself known to any one but myself.  And there was
yet another reason why she should shrink from
showing herself at Court, which Hal (thanks to his
ever-open eyes) was enabled to confide to me.  It had
been whispered that Sir Bernard had had, at one
time or another, some correspondence with Monmouth.
It was only a rumour, with no shadow of proof.
"Still," quoth Hal, "enough to make His Majesty
look somewhat coldly on the Dalrymples of
Horsemandown just at present."
</p>

<p>
'"If she was but your wife, Hal, instead of mine
you would manage it so much better."  Hal was, I
suspect, quite of the same opinion, though he did not
say so.  We then stood considering the subject in
silence for a minute.  "Marry, Hal, now I think of it,
I have a particularly bad chance with the Queen to-day!"
</p>

<p>
'"What!  because of Carlotte?  Ay, true enough.
I forgot that.  How very unlucky, to be sure!"
</p>

<p>
'Carlotte was one of those beautiful little black
spaniels, which King Charles had brought into fashion,
and which, in his time, quite swarmed wherever his
Court happened to be.  It was by the late King
himself that Carlotte had been given to my mistress, and
she certainly was one of the most perfect specimens
of her kind that I ever saw.  Not one of the Queen's
many pets was valued like Carlotte.  And you may
imagine into what dire disgrace I had brought myself
this morning, while we were walking in the park, by
throwing a large stone, in picking up which she had
broken three of her teeth!
</p>

<p>
'"Yes," pursued Hal, shaking his head with an air
of profound wisdom, "that certainly is against you.
You provoked her sorely by that piece of folly; and,
I warrant, you will be out of favour with her for the
rest of the day.  And no marvel either!  I'll tell
you what, Desmond!  I have an idea our best way
will be to get some one else to speak to the Queen&mdash;some
one who is a favourite of hers, who has a strong
influence over her, and whose word would have some
weight."
</p>

<p>
'I caught at this idea with great satisfaction; but
then, who was this some one to be?  Whose word
would have the most weight with her Majesty?  The
maids of honour were clearly out of the question.
One person after another came into my mind and was
rejected.
</p>

<p>
'"How would the Princess Anne do?" Hal suggested,
but in a doubtful tone.
</p>

<p>
'I shook my head.  Princess Anne was the very
soul of good-nature, it could not be denied; but had
she a strong influence over the Queen, or any one
else?  No, we had a great misgiving that she had not.
'"Hal," cried I suddenly, "I have it at last!
Father Niccolo!"
</p>

<p>
'"Bravo!" was Hal's enthusiastic reply.  "The
very man!"
</p>

<p>
'And he was the very man, as far as regarded
influence with the Queen; but whether he would be
likely to prove a warm partisan of one of the Taunton
rebels, the adherents of the "Protestant Duke," was
more doubtful; for Father Niccolo was the most
staunch, not to say bigoted of Papists.
</p>

<p>
'"No matter," said the undaunted Hal, when this
objection was started; "we must find some way of
making him do it."
</p>

<p>
'This bold yet simple plan for settling the difficulty
was really enough to take one's breath away.
</p>

<p>
'"Make him do it!" gasped I.  "The Queen's own
confessor!  Faith, Hal, that's more easily said than
done."
</p>

<p>
'"Very likely," responded Hal, with his wonted
coolness; "still, that's no proof that it can't be done
at all."
</p>

<p>
'"Well, how you can dream of making him do
anything, I can't for the life of me imagine."
</p>

<p>
'Neither could Hal, as he was fain to confess.  "At
least, not just at this moment," he said.  "But never
mind," he went on confidently; "wait a bit; we'll
lay our heads together, and some scheme shall be
hatched presently, I warrant you."
</p>

<p>
'"I suppose," I suggested, rather doubtfully, "there's
not much chance of persuading him to do it, if we
just go and tell him the whole story, simply, from
beginning to end."
</p>

<p>
'"Odds fish, no!" cried Hal hastily (it was the
fashion among the pages to affect this exclamation,
because it was always in the mouth of the late King).
"That is just like you, Algernon.  You always want
to go about matters in such a blundering, downright
way!  You were never born for a statesman, that's
quite clear."
</p>

<p>
'I suppose I was not, for my instinct always was
to use the simplest and quickest means possible to
gain my point.  I had an intense dislike to doing
things in a crooked, roundabout way; and if I made
the slightest attempt to do so, was sure to break down
hopelessly.  Now, Hal had undoubtedly a strong
taste for a little bit of intrigue.  Not that he would
do anything that he considered mean or dishonourable.
He had his own ideas of honour, and was
staunch enough to them; but his Court life had
begun very early, and had taught him a great many
things which shocked me when I first knew him.
Among them was this love of man[oe]uvring, which I
could neither understand nor take a share in,
notwithstanding my friendship for Hal.  But he was
older than I was; and I admired and respected
him so much that I generally gave way to his
opinion.
</p>

<p>
'"You see, we could not offer him a bribe worth
having," Hal presently pursued; "and even if we
could, I have my doubts as to whether he would take
it.  He is a superstitious fool, and chicken-hearted
enough for anything; but I don't think he is so greedy
as some folks that I wot of.  No!  Look you, Algernon,
this is what we must do; we must frighten him
into it."
</p>

<p>
'"Well, but how!  Do you mean by some trick of
goblins or demons?"
</p>

<p>
'"No, not that; though that were no bad notion
either.  There's nothing he would not believe.  But
I'll tell you the scheme I've thought of.  You know
Father Niccolo always paces up and down the green
walk under the chapel windows, reading his breviary
for some time before vespers.  Well, we'll be in hiding
in that dark alley leading down to the river, you and
I, and two or three more of us.  We must be right
well cloaked and masked, of course&mdash;in such guise
that he shall have no inkling as to who we are.  Then,
when Father Niccolo passes, out we rush, drag him
into the alley, and force a promise from him to pray
the Queen's grace for the maids of Taunton."
</p>

<p>
'"But, Hal, force a promise! how can that be
managed?  Father Niccolo is not very easily
browbeaten, I imagine."
</p>

<p>
'"Leave that to me," replied Hal, whose confidence
in his own powers seemed to increase with the
necessity for using them.  "It will be my business to
arrange about that.  Your legs and arms will be more
wanted in this affair than your tongue, Algernon; and
they are not to be despised in the matter of strength.  I
think I could be made to promise most things if held
in your grip, with no chance of being released until I
had passed my word.  But are you willing that I
should have the whole conduct of this affair?"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, certainly; if you are quite sure there is no
other way of gaining the pardon."
</p>

<p>
'"You must see yourself that this is the surest and
swiftest," cried Hal eagerly; and then he hastily ran
over the arguments which proved that every other
scheme must fail.  In fact, he was becoming so much
in love with his plot, that I am sure he would have
been highly disgusted if I had discovered a flaw in it,
or had suddenly devised a much better one.  But I
could not, and so was obliged to fall in, heart and soul,
with Hal's project.  I was not without some doubts
and scruples which I was ashamed to confess to him,
but which troubled me a good deal at first, though I
speedily forgot them in the excitement of planning and
carrying out our enterprise.
</p>

<p>
'"In the first place," said Hal, "we must get one or
two of the others to help us, who will keep our counsel,
and do as they are told.  Roger Crosbie for one, I
think, and Phil Buckthorne for the other."
</p>

<p>
'"Is he to be trusted?" I ask rather doubtingly.
</p>

<p>
'"To be sure?  He's too much of a blockhead to
make out the meaning of half our proceedings.  We
need only tell him that we want to give Father Niccolo
a fright.  That will be quite enough for his thick skull
to take in.  In the matter of cloaks and disguises, you
may trust me," Hal went on to say, looking very
important.  "I know of one who will get me all I want,
and ask no questions, either now or afterwards.  You
need not open your eyes so wide, Master Innocence;
but just go and secure Phil and Roger, and let out as
little of the project as need be to them.  They'll be
ready enough to join us, I warrant, for the sake of the
frolic."
</p>

<p>
'And he went off, whistling a bar of the "Old and
Young Courtier"&mdash;a tune for which he had a great
partiality&mdash;while I proceeded on the mission entrusted
to me, distracted between my admiration for Hal's
cleverness and a haunting fear which would beset me
that we were not going the right way to work.
</p>

<p>
'It was quite dusk (about eight o'clock, I think)
when we four conspirators, being released from attendance
on the Queen till supper-time, one by one left the
great gallery where most of our fellow-pages were
congregated, and slipped away to don our disguises, and
make our way down to the Palace gardens, which Hal
had appointed as our place of meeting.  Hal's mysterious
friend evidently understood the art of concealment.
We were cloaked and muffled to the eyes;
and so tall and broad did my three companions look,
that I hardly recognised them in the dim light.  They
were all in excellent spirits.  Roger Crosbie and Phil
Buckthorne (who, as I ought to have told you, was a
brother of Lady Sarah's) had taken mightily to the
idea of reducing Father Niccolo to a state of abject
submission, by means of his fears.  A Popish priest
was considered fair game; and they offered not only
to keep him prisoner in the dark passage till Hal had
worked his will upon him, but also, if need were, to
duck the unfortunate father in the river which ran at
the further end of the alley.  But Hal pronounced
this to be both impolitic and unnecessary; and
beseeching us to be silent and cautious, he led the way
to our hiding-place.
</p>

<p>
'At the time at which I am speaking, the chapel
and the Queen's apartments at Whitehall were all <i>en
suite</i>; so that, when you stood in the green walk facing
the chapel windows, you had the gardens on your left
hand, with the windows of the Queen's rooms looking
into them, and behind you a block of buildings, through
which ran the narrow passage wherein we were to
hide.
</p>

<p>
'And there we crouched down, waiting, with our
eyes fixed on the strip of grass and paved walk, which
were all we could see from the narrow opening in
front of us, till it grew so dark, that it was impossible
to distinguish between grass and pavement; and I
began to fear that when Father Niccolo did come, we
should not be able to see him.
</p>

<p>
'"I am beginning to feel uncommonly like Guy
Fawkes," whispered Roger, half laughing, in my ear.
</p>

<p>
'I myself had been feeling so for some time; and
it was only by calling up to my mind's eye a picture
of poor Lady Dalrymple sitting lonely in her lodgings,
waiting for the good news I was to bring her, that I
could force myself to stay where I was, and go through
with the undertaking.  Just then the chapel bell
began to ring for vespers; and between the strokes
we distinctly heard a footstep echoing on the flagged
pathway.
</p>

<p>
'"He's coming!" said Hal below his breath.  And
springing to his feet, he peered eagerly into the
darkness.
</p>

<p>
'A figure was passing between us and the faint
glimmer of light, which was all that remained, and in
another moment it was surrounded, seized, enveloped
over head and shoulders in a large cloak, and dragged
struggling into the dark archway.  The old priest
fought desperately; and Roger and I were obliged to
pinion his hands behind him with both our own before
Hal dared raise the muffler, and whisper in his ear,
"You are safe.  Only be still, and no one shall harm
you."
</p>

<p>
'A piercing scream was the only answer; and at
the same moment I let go my hold, calling out in
dismay, "Hal!  Hal!  It's a woman!  I felt the rings
on her hands."
</p>

<p>
'The woman, whoever she was, feeling our grasp on
her arms loosen, made a violent effort, and slipping
from our hands, darted up the alley, and disappeared
from sight.
</p>

<p>
'"Idiots that you were, to let her go!" cried Hal
furiously.  "We must after her, and bribe her to hold
her tongue, or she will raise a hue and cry, and we
shall have a dozen people at our heels before we can
reach the Palace."
</p>

<p>
'Off we started in hot pursuit, guided by the faint
sound of footsteps flying in the direction of the chapel,
which was the nearest place of refuge.  But, alas! as
ill luck would have it, Phil Buckthorne, whose legs
were as quick as his brain was slow, was foremost in the
race.  He overtook the flying figure on the threshold
of the chapel, and disregarding Hal's warning cry,
which was raised as high as he dared, rushed in after
her.  The rest of us, when we reached the door,
hesitated a moment what to do next.  If we had taken to
our heels then, we might have escaped scathless; but
we could not leave Philip in the lurch, and so, after a
pause of a few seconds, we followed his example, and
went in.  The chapel was lighted up in preparation for
vespers; and the first person who met our astonished
and horrified gaze was Lady Sarah Buckthorne! who
sat sobbing on a chair by the altar, supported by Father
Niccolo.  In front of her stood Philip, looking utterly
abashed and confounded, while he repeated slowly:
</p>

<p>
'"I tell you, sister, we meant no harm.  There is no
need to be frightened.  'Twas all a mistake."
</p>

<p>
'"No need to be frightened!" cried Lady Sarah
angrily.  "I ask you, father, if it was not enough to
frighten me when a whole gang of young ruffians set
on me at once, dragged me into a dark entry, and
bound my hands behind me?"
</p>

<p>
'"There were but four of us," said Phil, looking
very sheepish.
</p>

<p>
'He certainly had a talent for making matters
worse, for he went on:
</p>

<p>
'"I shouldn't have touched you if I had known
who it was; but we took you for Father Niccolo, you
see."
</p>

<p>
'Lady Sarah laughed hysterically.
</p>

<p>
'Father Niccolo exclaimed, "Holy mother! what
iniquity is this?"  And Hal, seeing that all was lost,
pushed past Philip, after privately shaking his fist at
him, and stopped any further revelations by beginning
a series of the most profuse apologies to the
injured Lady Sarah.  But Hal had been so taken
aback on discovering who our prisoner really was
that his words did not come quite so readily as usual.
She would not listen.  She had been very much
frightened, and now she was very angry.  Moreover,
she was by no means so thick-witted as her brother,
and was evidently beginning to suspect that our
unlucky plot was something more than a mere
frolic.
</p>

<p>
'"The Queen shall hear of this, sir," she replied
to Hal's protestations.  "You and your accomplices
must be taught that her Majesty's ladies are not to be
put in fear for their lives with impunity.  You, Hal
Verney, have been the ringleader in all sorts of
mischief too long.  It is time that your pranks should be
put a stop to."
</p>

<p>
'"But, madam, hear me one minute.  It was my
doing.  It was for my sake that Hal&mdash;that we&mdash;&mdash;  In
fact, if this comes to her Majesty's ears, the blame
must rest with me," cried I, unable to keep silence
any longer.
</p>

<p>
'"You here, my Lord Desmond!" cried Lady
Sarah, while Hal plucked my sleeve impatiently to
force me to be quiet (he had so much more faith
in his own powers of persuasion than in those of any
one else)&mdash;"I could not have believed it," Lady Sarah
went on.  "This matter must be sifted to the
bottom."
</p>

<p>
'"It must, madam," interrupted Father Niccolo,
who was evidently anxious to oust so many heretics
from his chapel; "but this is not the place for the
inquiry.  The hour for vespers has struck, and I am
expecting every moment&mdash;&mdash;  There! it is too late."  And
so it was, for at that moment the doors at the
other end of the chapel which communicated with
the Queen's rooms were thrown open, and Her
Majesty, leaning on the arm of the Lord Chamberlain,
and followed by a crowd of her Roman Catholic
attendants, advanced down the aisle.
</p>

<p>
'Of course the group at the altar broke up in
confusion.  Lady Sarah slipped quietly into her place
amongst the other maids of honour, contriving to
whisper me as she passed, "I <i>must</i> see you this evening
before supper."  Father Niccolo glided noiselessly
into his stall, and we four, who, as Protestants, were
not required to attend the Queen at her devotions,
beat a hasty retreat to the door by which we had
entered.  It was accomplished in a moment, but it
needed only one glance at the astonished face of
the Queen to assure us that we had been observed.
If we had had any hope before of Lady Sarah's tender
mercies, or of Father Niccolo's good-nature, we had
none now.  Her Majesty would never forgive such
an unwarrantable intrusion into her private chapel.
Hal's most flowery apologies would be of no use
now, and I might consider my suit as hopeless.
We were all in rather low spirits as we walked away.
Hal and Roger relieved their minds by abusing Phil
Buckthorne; but I was too much out of heart even to
do that.  Here was the day almost at an end, and I
was not one whit nearer fulfilling my promise to
Lady Dalrymple than I had been in the morning.
Indeed, difficult as I had thought it then to ask a
grace of the Queen, it seemed almost impossible now.
And Lady Dalrymple had implored me above all
things to be speedy.  I was at my wit's end to know
what to do in the matter next, and gave vent to my
perplexities in such a heavy sigh, that Hal clapped
me on the shoulder, saying:
</p>

<p>
'"Cheer up, Algernon.  I've been in and out of
many a worse strait than this.  The Queen's anger
won't last for ever; and even if she does flout us for
a time, we can live very well without Court favour."
</p>

<p>
'"'Tis not that, as you know full well," said I,
rather roughly, for Hal's nonchalance was particularly
irritating just then.  "But how am I ever now to
get the Queen's favourable ear for that other business?"
</p>

<p>
'"Whew!" ejaculated Hal in a sort of prolonged
whistle.  "I declare that I had quite forgotten all
about it.  Well, of all mishaps in the world, only
think that we should have had the ill luck to
run against Lady Sarah!  She'll not rest till she
ferrets out the whole story.  What was it she said to
you as we were coming out of the chapel?"
</p>

<p>
'When I told him he shook his head despondingly.
</p>

<p>
'"That bodes us no good, I'm afraid," said he.
"She will never forgive us for the way we used her.
I must confess the poor lady did get some rough
handling among us.  That grasp of yours on her
shoulder must have been anything but pleasant.
And how we dragged her mantle and hood about!
I remember hearing a great rent, and thinking
what wretched stuff the good father's gown must
be made of."
</p>

<p>
'Hal went into a fit of laughter at the
remembrance, which put the finishing stroke to my
ill-humour.  I broke away from him, and would not
hear when he called after me:
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, but hear me, Algernon.  I have thought
of a plan."
</p>

<p>
'I resolved, however, that I would have nothing
to do with Hal's plans for the future, and marched
away to await my interview with Lady Sarah,
feeling more angry with him than I had ever done
before, and most ungrateful for his well-meant
attempts to assist me.  Phil Buckthorne at last
summoned me to his sister's presence.
</p>

<p>
'"She has been asking me about a hundred
questions," said he, "and boxed my ears for a
simpleton when I told her 'twas only a frolic of ours
to frighten Father Niccolo.  She has got some
maggot in her head, but what it is I can't say."
</p>

<p>
'I had only time for a hearty though secret wish
that Lady Sarah was as great a simpleton as her
brother, before I found myself standing within
the door of her chamber, and face to face with the
lady herself.  Her sharp, black eyes seemed to look
me through and through; and before I had settled
how much of my secret I ought to reveal for the
sake of shielding my companions, and how much I
ought to keep back for the sake of Lady Dalrymple,
she had drawn the whole story from me by a few
skilful questions.  Indeed, I soon found that she
knew so much already about the danger my wife was
in, and the pardon I had promised to obtain, that it
was hopeless to try and keep anything from her.
</p>

<p>
'"And so for once in his life Master Hal Verney's
schemes have miscarried," she said, with a mischievous
laugh, "and you are farther from your object
than ever.  That boy's love of intrigue will be the
plague of the whole Court by and by.  I am
heartily glad he should have been found out, even
though I was the victim of this plot of his.  I shall
not grudge the fright he gave me, if it is the means
of bringing on him the punishment his tricks so
richly deserve.  Indeed, there is not much doubt that
he will receive that.  The Queen is justly angry, both
at what she saw of the unseemly invasion of her
chapel, and also at what Father Niccolo has told her
of your designs upon him, which my wise brother
Phil so obligingly revealed.  She hath already
commissioned my Lord Chamberlain to make all inquiries
upon the subject.  So I am in great hopes that
Master Hal Verney will either be dismissed from his
pageship altogether, or at least find himself banished
for a time to the solitudes of Windsor or Hampton
Court, where he would find ample leisure to meditate
upon his own ill-doings, and learn to amend his ways
for the future."
</p>

<p>
'Lady Sarah looked so thoroughly and maliciously
in earnest as she expressed her hopes of Hal's speedy
disgrace, that I could not help exclaiming indignantly:
</p>

<p>
'"But why Hal more than any of the rest of us?
You know, Lady Sarah, it is I who ought to get the
worst of the punishment, whatever it may be.  It was
all my doing."
</p>

<p>
'"Tut, tut, child, never tell me," replied her
Ladyship.  "'Twas Hal Verney arranged the whole
affair, I dare answer for it.  I know his pranks of old.
As for the rest, Phil deserves a punishment for not
knowing his own sister, and I care not a jot what
becomes of Roger Crosbie."
</p>

<p>
'"But I do," I burst out.  "Roger and Phil knew
nothing of our plans; they only joined for the sake of
the frolic.  I will go to the Queen and tell her
everything, and say that if any one is to be banished or
dismissed, it ought to me."
</p>

<p>
'"Indeed!" said Lady Sarah dryly.  "And when
you have given Her Majesty your instructions, and
she has perchance followed your advice, and had you
turned out of the Palace for a malapert rogue, pray
what becomes of my Lady Desmond and your promise
to her mother?"
</p>

<p>
'I stamped my foot on the ground with a sort of
impatient despair as I thought of Frances, sick and
lonely, and of Lady Dalrymple's face of misery when
she implored my help.
</p>

<p>
'"What am I to do?" I muttered half-aloud,
clenching my fists with a most gentlemanlike desire
to knock Lady Sarah down.
</p>

<p>
'"Listen to me," she replied quietly, "and perhaps
I shall be able to devise some means for getting you
out of your trouble."
</p>

<p>
'I stared at the lady incredulously.  Decidedly she
was the very last person I should have thought likely
to help me.  Besides the rough treatment she had
received at my hands this very evening, which had, as
I thought, made her my enemy for ever, was she not
one of the very maids of honour who were to profit
by the ransom of the Taunton girls?  A very odd
smile hovered in the corners of Lady Sarah's mouth
as she watched my face.
</p>

<p>
'"I daresay you would not have chosen me for a
confidante," she went on; "but you cannot help
yourself now, so you must attend to me.  Unclench
your hand, and don't look so furious, or I shall be
afraid to stay in the room with you.  I have felt
enough of your strength to-night, sir, to desire no
further exhibition of it."
</p>

<p>
'Lady Sarah glanced at a bruise on her wrist as
she spoke; and I, feeling thoroughly ashamed of
myself, could only turn very red and endeavour to
stammer out an apology.
</p>

<p>
'"There, never mind that now," she proceeded.
"What I want you to understand is this.  Though I
care nothing for what becomes of those boys (and I
see you think me very hard-hearted for saying so),
yet I am not quite so relentless as you doubtless
imagine.  I wish to save you from the consequences
of your own folly.  You are not like Hal Verney,
who is always planning escapades of this kind for the
sake of the intrigue, and the excitement; nor like
Philip and Roger, who would engage in anything that
promised them a frolic.  You had some reason for
joining in this wild scheme, ill-advised as it was, and
therefore I will do my best to help you.  My brother
Philip is to ride to-morrow in the train of the Princess
Anne, who goes to pay my Lord of Rochester a visit.
You shall go in his place.  The Princess will be away
from Court nearly a week, and by that time this affair
will have blown over.  In the meantime I shall tell the
Queen that there were but three of you who pursued me
in mistake for Father Niccolo.  She need never know
of your being there at all; for she had no time to see
how many of you were in the chapel, and the good
father will not be able to inform her, for he scarcely
knows one of you from the other, and certainly not
you, you obstinate little heretic, who keep so
carefully aloof from him.  I will take care that Philip
does not betray you; and I suppose you may safely
count on the honour of Roger and Hal.  Is it not so?"
</p>

<p>
'"Madam, you are very good," I stammered out,
after a pause of extreme astonishment.  "But, but&mdash;how
can I possibly put myself in safety, while the others
are left in the lurch?  They would never betray me, I
know that; but that is the very reason!  Oh, it is
impossible that I should leave them!"
</p>

<p>
'"Foolish boy, what good can your staying be to
them?  I can take care of my own brother, I suppose;
and as to the rest, they will get no more than they
deserve.  Besides," Lady Sarah went on, speaking
low, and very eagerly, "you must see that, if the
Queen once discovers that you were mixed up in this
business, you lose all chance of prospering in your
suit.  Whereas, if you keep your own counsel, deny
all knowledge of the affair, and follow out my
directions, I'll wager anything you like that your part in
the doings of to-night never comes to the Queen's
ears at all.  Then you come back in a week's time,
when Her Majesty has forgotten the misbehaviour of
her pages.  You present your petition, tell the
touching story of your bride's imprisonment, and
carry your point with flying colours."
</p>

<p>
'But I had not been a courtier long enough to
appreciate the full force of Lady Sarah's arguments.
My life at Whitehall had done me no good.  I did
things now which would have horrified me to see done
by others six months before.  I was becoming used to
the selfishness, the scheming, and the want of principle
shown by nearly every one around me; but I had
never yet told a deliberate lie, nor allowed one to be
told in my name.  So I refused Lady Sarah's proposal
again very decidedly, feeling hotly indignant
that she should think me capable of the amount of
deceit and treachery which the plan she proposed
would imply.  She only laughed at my anger, however,
and protested that a page who never told a lie
was a being who had never existed; that falsehood
came as naturally to him as doubling and winding to a
coursed hare, and was quite as necessary to his security.
</p>

<p>
'"As necessary as listening behind doorways to
ladies of honour," said I, unable to resist giving vent
to a suspicion which had flashed into my mind at the
beginning of our conversation.  In what way but by
eavesdropping could Lady Sarah have obtained such
an intimate knowledge of all Lady Dalrymple had
said to me in the oratory?
</p>

<p>
'"Well, sir," she replied very coolly, though perhaps
there was a shade more of red in her cheeks than
before, "if I had not happened to overhear some of
that interesting discourse this morning, how should
I have been able to help you out of your difficulties
to-night?  You would never have told me your secret
of your own accord."
</p>

<p>
'I involuntarily shook my head, and then, with a
great effort to keep my temper, said, "I can't see why
you should care to help me, madam.  If you really
do, I thank you; but I cannot do as you would have
me, so I must manage this business as best I can.
I know I have very little chance with the Queen, but
I must try."
</p>

<p>
'"As you like it," replied Her Ladyship, shrugging
her shoulders, and laughing a disagreeable little laugh.
"You refuse my assistance, and imagine you can win
a grace from Her Majesty by your own diplomatic
talents!  We shall see."
</p>

<p>
'"We shall see," I repeated mechanically, as I
closed the door and walked away, after an elaborate
farewell salutation to Lady Sarah; but I felt more
down-hearted and uncertain what course to pursue
than ever.  I paced slowly along the corridor, pondering
on Lady Sarah's proposal, so very strange and so
unlooked-for from her, when suddenly an idea darted
into my mind that directly threw a light on her
meaning.  Of course she was scheming to prevent my
appeal to the Queen.  Her policy was to send me out
of the way for the present, until she could in some
way contrive to render my petition useless, or
perhaps put a stop to my presenting it altogether.  Why
had I been so dull as not to think of this before?
For, as I said just now, Lady Sarah was one of the
very persons for whose benefit these cruel ransoms
were to be extorted.  What was to be done?  She
had failed, to be sure, in baiting properly the first
little trap she had laid for me; but there were many
ether ways, of course, in which she might easily
manage to thwart me.
</p>

<p>
'Why had I not followed my first impulse, and
gone at once to the Queen in a straightforward
manner?  Why had I allowed Hal to persuade me
for a moment that the crooked path could ever be the
best?  But, after all, why should I not take the
straight path now?  It seemed to me, without doubt
the only thing to be done under the circumstances,
and I resolved to do it.  I would go to the Queen
directly, without waiting for the next chance opportunity,
and tell her my story before Lady Sarah should
have time to stand between us.  Yes, happen what
might, I determined to make my petition without any
more delay, with the forlorn hope that Her Majesty's
pity and kind-heartedness might grant it in spite of
my unlucky piece of misconduct.  I had been pausing
on the staircase while I turned these things over in
my mind, and, having settled at last what my course
of action was to be, my spirits suddenly rose to such
a pitch that I felt it necessary to work them off by
indulging in a slide down the bannisters (at home I
very seldom went down-stairs in any other way,
unless there was a chance of meeting Lady Mountfort,
or Father Freeling); but, since my Court life began,
opportunities did not come as often as I could have
wished.  However, here was an excellent one!  For
once in a way not a soul was in sight, above or below,
so up I vaulted, and shot down to the first landing-place
like lightning.  But oh! what were my feelings,
when, just as I started on my second journey, the
Queen herself suddenly emerged from a passage, and
advanced towards the foot of the stairs!  One desperate
attempt I made to stop myself, but only succeeded
in giving my pace such an impetus, that I
barely escaped charging straight into Her Majesty's
arms.  It seemed to me that I certainly was the very
unluckiest person in Christendom.  Just at this
particular time, when it was so especially important to
me to be in the Queen's good graces, who but I could
have contrived to offend her twice in the same
evening?  I glanced nervously at her face, which showed
plainly enough that she was extremely angry.  As
for me, I felt for a moment as if I had quite as much
cause for anger as she had.  Why need she have
appeared just at that minute, and just in that particular
place, too, where no one could possibly expect
to meet her?  A Queen, in my opinion, had no right
to wander about in the region of the back-stairs, and
take her pages by surprise when they were having
a little harmless enjoyment.  So, what with my
confusion and vexation, by way of mending matters, I
forgot to utter a word of apology, and stood stock-still
before her, conscious of torn and crumpled ruffles,
that the bow of my cravat was behind instead of
before, and that there was a slit of appalling length in
my claret-coloured velvet sleeve.
</p>

<p>
'"Well, sir, have you nothing to say for yourself?"
was Her Majesty's exclamation, after the first pause
of indignant surprise.  "Perhaps you expect me to ask
pardon for intruding upon your Lordship's privacy?"
</p>

<p>
<a id="p266"></a>
'"I crave your Majesty's pardon with all my heart,"
I stammered out, as awkwardly as if I had been a
horse-boy or a cow-herd, instead of a young courtier.
</p>

<p>
"I was only&mdash;that is&mdash;I never&mdash;&mdash;"  But Her Majesty
cut me short with what I thought a perfectly withering
smile, and a sharp "Enough, enough!  Was ever such
a bear before in the guise of a lady's page?  You may
go, sir; and I beg that this may be the last I see of
you to-night.  To-morrow that escapade of yours in
the chapel must be inquired into; and I warn you
that Father Niccolo shall not be insulted with impunity
while my word has any weight in the Palace."  And
she swept past me with a look in her face which I knew
quite well, and which always seemed completely to
shut one's lips.  When I saw the corners of her
mouth drawn down, and that particular flash in her
eyes, I felt that all poor Lady Dalrymple's hopes of
my intercession had been in vain.  Through my own
fault I had lost every chance of gaining my suit.  I
stared after the Queen despairingly.  She was going
up the staircase, perhaps to Lady Sarah's room!  I
remembered my resolution of only five minutes ago.
Now was the time to speak if I was to speak at all
Yes, now or never!  It would be useless, of course&mdash;of
that I felt hardly a doubt; but it would be cowardly
to give up without an effort, so that effort must be made.
The next moment I was at the top of the staircase,
pouring out my whole story to the astonished Queen,
who stood perfectly breathless with bewilderment at
my extraordinary, not to say daring behaviour.  I told
her everything from beginning to end without stopping,
for fear she should dismiss me before hearing the
whole&mdash;everything, that is, relating to my own affairs.
I said as little as could be helped about Hal Verney,
and nothing at all about Lady Sarah's proposal.  There
was no need to bring that in, and I did not want to
accuse her unnecessarily.  It was not till I had
finished that I ventured to look up anxiously into
the Queen's face.  I was curious, and yet somewhat
afraid, to see the effect which my unwonted
proceedings would produce.  Her mouth was not drawn
down now&mdash;that was certainly a relief.  I drew a
long breath, and waited with beating heart and
burning cheeks for her answer.  When she did speak at
length, it was not as she had spoken a few minutes
before&mdash;not in the sharp icy tone that I had more
than half expected to hear.
</p>

<p>
'"Come into my cabinet, child; this is not the
place to discuss such matters in.  I must hear this
tale of yours over again, a little more clearly."
</p>

<p>
'And I followed her, quite trembling with pent-up
eagerness, down-stairs (not this time on the
balustrade), and into her own private cabinet.  There my
story had to be told again, interrupted very often
by questions from the Queen, who seemed to listen with
a great interest and attention when I repeated what
Lady Dalrymple had told me about the troubles that
my poor little wife had gone through, and the sickness
and danger she was in at present.  A really pained look
came over her face, and her eyes filled with
tears&mdash;somewhat to my amazement, I must say.  That she
was generous and warm-hearted, in spite of her pride
and quick temper, and that she could sometimes do
extremely kind things in a fit of impulse, I knew
well enough; but that she should care so much for
Frances' misfortunes as to cry over them, was more
than I had dreamed of expecting, now especially,
when I had just made her so angry.  It was strange
that she could feel so much pity for one person, and
yet so little for all the rest of the miserable people who
were suffering every day from having taken part in
the Western Rebellion, some of whom were undergoing
far more terrible punishments than the Taunton
girls.  Scores had been hung or beheaded, one or two
even burned, and many shipped off as slaves to the
colonies.  I wondered whether she had felt as much
distress for the Duke of Monmouth; whether she had
tried at all to save him, or any of the unhappy
prisoners whose friends were daily sending fruitless
petitions to the Palace.  If she could but have heard
each one's story as she had heard mine, she never
could have shown so much indifference to their fate.
But all could not be saved, of course, whatever her
wishes might be.  Perhaps that was the reason why
she appeared to be careless of all alike.
</p>

<p>
'In these speculations, however, I was soon
interrupted by a tap on the shoulder from the Queen.
</p>

<p>
'"What are you knitting your brows about, child?
Is it that you feel a husband's cares and responsibilities
too much for you?  Well, it is somewhat hard,
I grant, for the troubles of married life to begin thus
early.  But never fear!  I think I may promise to
help you out of the present one.  I will speak to the
King to-night on behalf of this poor little wife of
yours."
</p>

<p>
'How I thanked Her Majesty I really have not
the smallest recollection.  The boon that I feared
was lost entirely, and all through my own folly, was
actually gained after all; and I need not describe my
relief and delight, which were all the greater for the
difficulties I had gone through, and my hopelessness
at last of winning it.  How glad I felt now!  How
very, very glad that I had made and kept that
resolution&mdash;hard as it was at the time&mdash;and had spoken out
boldly and straightforwardly to the Queen!  If I had
kept silence, then I should most likely have found
no other chance of speaking at all.  Yes, I had done
what was right, and that is the one deed which one
never can regret.  Not a very original remark, I am
quite aware of that; but I never felt the truth of it so
strongly in my life as then, and I have never forgotten
it since.
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, you must not be too sure of my success,"
the Queen said, smiling, perhaps a little bitterly, as I
tried to express my gratitude.  "I will do my best;
but remember, my power has a limit, though you look
as though you scarce believed that.  Ah, well!&mdash;now
you may leave me.  I will send a messenger to Lady
Dalrymple, and bid her wait upon me early
to-morrow morning.  And, Algernon," she continued, as
I knelt to kiss her hand before leaving the room,
"you and your companions must make an apology
for your rudeness to Father Niccolo, and the affair
shall be passed over for this time, on condition that
we hear no more of such crazy tricks for the future."
</p>

<p>
'It was all I could do to murmur out more thanks,
and walk soberly out of Her Majesty's presence after
this.  And the first thing I did, when I found myself
out of earshot, was to give vent to my feelings in a
burst of whistling; after which I rushed off in search
of Hal Verney, most anxious to make up the first
quarrel we had ever had.  He heard the news of how
well my suit prospered with great satisfaction, though
not, perhaps, with quite as much as if the cause had
been carried by means of his own contrivance.  However,
I think he was somewhat consoled for the failure
of that ingenious plan, when I told him that we had
nothing to fear now on the score of Father Niccolo.
</p>

<p>
'What a long day that was to look back upon!  It
seemed as if a week had gone by since I was called
in from the bowling-green to see Lady Dalrymple.
For the first time in my life, I could not go to sleep
directly my head was on the pillow, but lay awake,
thinking of Frances in the Taunton jail, and wondering
whether the order for release would, after all, come
in time to save her.
</p>

<p>
'"My Lord Desmond, you are wanted in her
Majesty's closet," said one of the Queen's
officers-in-waiting, as he passed me in the ante-chamber the
next morning.
</p>

<p>
'It was yet quite early; and though I had just been
attending on Her Majesty at breakfast, she had made
no allusion to her promise of the night before, except
to favour me with a gracious nod and smile, which I
thought looked encouraging.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose the gentleman saw me start and colour
at his message, for he whispered to Roger Crosbie
as I moved away, "What's in the wind now?  Desmond
looks as if some madcap prank were on his
conscience.  Has he got into trouble with the Queen,
think you?"
</p>

<p>
'"Marry, no, I trust not!" I heard Roger say in
a loud and horrified tone.  "Why, I thought he told
me we were out of that quandary!  Sure he can't
have tumbled into it again already!"
</p>

<p>
'I did not wait to reassure Roger, but rushed off
with all speed to the painted cabinet, which room
was an especial favourite of the Queen's, and generally
went by the name of her "closet."  She was not
there when I went in; there was only a tall lady in
black standing by the window whom I recognised
this time without difficulty.
</p>

<p>
'"Well, Algernon," she said, coming to meet me
with outstretched hands; "thank you a thousand
times.  You have gained your wife's liberty.  God
grant that it may not be too late to save her life!"
</p>

<p>
'The last words gave me rather a chill; for though
the doubt had also occurred to me, I could not bear to
think that she also had the same fears.
</p>

<p>
'"Then she is to be released, madam?" I asked,
eagerly.  "The King has really granted a pardon?"
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, a free pardon at the Queen's intercession.
The whole of the fine is remitted, and I am going to
bring her home.  I start for Taunton in an hour.
Poor heart," and she sighed, repeating half to herself,
"if only I am not too late!"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, pray, madam, do not say so," I cried earnestly.
"You will not be too late,&mdash;indeed you will not!
When once she is taken out of that horrible place,
with you to nurse her too, she must get well.  Oh, the
sight of you will do her good directly, I am sure
it will!"
</p>

<p>
"'I shall tell her what she owes to you," said Lady
Dalrymple, taking my hands again, with tears in her
kind, soft brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
'"I thank you again in her name, with all my heart.
May I give your love to her, my dear?"
</p>

<p>
'I murmured with some difficulty a shy "Yes, if
you please, madam."  And then, as voices and
footsteps were heard approaching the door, she drew me
suddenly into her arms, and kissed me as if I had
been one of Frances' brothers.
</p>

<p>
'"You are my son, you know, Algernon," she said,
with a sort of half-apologetic smile.  "God bless you,
my dear boy, and keep both you and her!"
</p>

<p>
'Some of the Queen's ladies entered at that moment
to summon Lady Dalrymple once more to their
mistress's presence; and so I said farewell to my
mother-in-law, and for the last time, though I little
thought so then.
</p>

<p>
'Hal Verney, who, of course, had contrived to find
out more of the matter than anybody else, informed
me that Frances was not the only one to whom I had
done good service by my petition.  The Queen had
inquired strictly into the matter of the Taunton
maidens, and had been much displeased with several
of her ladies for the lengths they had gone in it, and
the hard-heartedness they had shown in the affair.
Owing to her remonstrances, when she found out
this, all the fines were decreased to about a third
of what had been demanded at first; and one or two
of the girls, whose parents were really poor, received,
like Frances, a free pardon.
</p>

<p>
'I was very glad to hear this, for Agnes Blount's
sake especially.  She was at Newcourt when I went
there for a short visit at Christmas; and from her I
heard the whole story of the part which Madame
St. Aubert's school had taken in Monmouth's insurrection,
and the troubles which had befallen it in
consequence.  Agnes had been lately staying at
Horsemandown, and she told me, as a great secret, that
Lady Dalrymple wished very much that I should pay
a visit there, but that Sir Harry, and more especially,
Lady Mountfort, had resolutely refused to hear of it.
Why, I could not wholly understand till afterwards;
but I remember how desperately angry and disappointed
I felt at the time.
</p>

<p>
'Well! you have heard all my Lady Desmond's
adventures fully enough from her own mouth, so there
is no need for me to say anything more about them.
I will only tell you that she quite recovered from that
terrible prison fever, though her sickness was a very
long and serious one.  Perhaps you may also like to
know that Henrietta Sydney entirely escaped the
infection.  She stayed a long time at Horsemandown,
helping Lady Dalrymple to nurse poor little Frances; and
the friendship that began in Taunton jail was never
interrupted to the end of both their lives.'

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br><br>
THE MAID OF HONOUR'S STORY.
</h3>

<p>
'Robin, I'm quite sure now that Uncle
Algernon is writing a book about
Bluecoat and Lady Greensleeves,' whispered
Silvia, as they walked away from the
dressing-room.  'Didn't you notice how he got up at
once, and looked at a paper in his desk, just when he
was in the middle of the story?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I wish he would write a little more about
Blue-coat, then,' observed Robin with a sigh.  'I
liked it so very much.'
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said Silvia meditatively, 'I am not quite
sure whether Lady Greensleeves' story wasn't the
nicest; only I wanted to hear some more about
Henrietta.'  But oh! Robin, don't you want to know
about Frances and Algernon when they were grown
up, and how they met again, and whether they liked
one another?'
</p>

<p>
'I'll tell you what, Silvia.  We'll go back to-morrow,
and ask Uncle Algernon whether he knows any more
of their stories.  I daresay he does, though he didn't
say so.'
</p>

<p>
And accordingly, the next afternoon, Uncle Algernon
once more heard a tap at the door of his dressing-room;
and this time, when Silvia and Robin put their
heads in, he was discovered standing before two
portraits, which had been missing all that day from
the staircase wall.  One of these, labelled 'Frances
Countess of Desmond, ætat 24,' was a stately dame, in
the dress worn by the ladies of William and Mary's
time&mdash;stiff and long-waisted, cut low in the neck, and
with sleeves reaching to the elbow.  But, despite the
difference in dress and age, the wavy dark hair, the
brilliant complexion, and the arch grey eyes could
not be mistaken.  Fourteen years had made very
little change in Lady Greensleeves.  The same,
however, could not be said for poor Blue-coat.  The
bright sturdy boy that Kneller had painted bore
scarcely any resemblance to the grave Lord Desmond
of twenty-eight.  His once round, rosy face was thin
and brown, and his curly auburn locks were exchanged
for a black periwig.
</p>

<p>
'Can you really be Blue-coat?' Robin could not
help saying, after staring for some while at him in
silence.
</p>

<p>
'Blue-coat grown up,' Uncle Algernon answered,
smiling; 'and a good deal changed, but not for the
better, eh, Robin?  Well! so you want to hear his
history now, I suppose?'
</p>

<p>
'Oh yes, uncle, please; and Lady Greensleeves
grown-up story too.  You know you have heard
them,' pleaded Silvia, trying to pull him into the big
leather chair.  'I am quite sure they told them both
to you last night.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' added Robin.  'And you are going away
to-morrow; and then you will be off to Egypt, and
nobody knows when you will come back.  So if
you don't tell them, we shall never hear them at
all.'
</p>

<p>
'Unless you leave the goloshes of Fortune behind
you,' suggested Silvia mischievously.
</p>

<p>
'Ah! hem!  You see, I'm afraid they would fit no
one but myself,' Uncle Algernon answered, with a
twinkle in his grey eyes.  'But, as you say, Robin,
this is my last day here, and these stories are not
quite so long as the others, so we will see what can
be done.'
</p>

<p>
And after Robin and Silvia had waited for a
moment in breathless silence, Uncle Algernon cleared
his throat, and began as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'I am not going to tell you all about my life, from
the time I was carried out of Taunton jail until I was
what you call "grown up."  I shall take up my story
at the time when I was maid of honour to Queen
Mary the Second, and pass over, in the very briefest
way, all the events which took place before that
period.  I must, however, explain how it came to pass
that I attained such a dignity.  My father had
left England soon after the failure of Monmouth's
Rebellion, and then joined heart and soul with the
party of the Prince of Orange, and had rendered him
such services, that when, a year and a half afterwards,
William and Mary were proclaimed King and Queen
of Great Britain, my father returned to England in
their train, one of the most distinguished of their
courtiers.  Sir Bernard Dalrymple had played his
cards well, everybody said; and if some of his friends
whispered a suspicion that his attachment to the new
sovereign was not entirely disinterested, his wife and
children remembered simply that his influence had
been exerted in the cause of English liberty and good
government, and could join with all their hearts in the
Church's yearly thanksgiving for "the deliverance of
their nation from Popish tyranny and arbitrary power."
And thus it was that, Sir Bernard continuing in high
favour at Court, his daughter, as soon as she was old
enough, was appointed one of the Queen's maids of
honour, and so took the first step towards obtaining
that splendid position which had been prophesied for
her years before.  Poor Sir Harry Mountfort!  I hope
my added years and mamma's teaching had somewhat
increased my wisdom since the days when his
flatteries had turned my head; but I confess I
could not help thinking of his words with a slight
feeling of satisfaction, when the news of my
promotion was first announced to me.  I am afraid that,
like a silly girl as I was, the peaceful regularity
of life at Horsemandown did not satisfy me so
entirely as to prevent an occasional wish for
something more exciting.  What was the use of being
Countess Desmond, if one was to be always shut
up in the country?  Why should I trouble myself
to learn so many accomplishments, if I had no
one to dance with but Oliver? no one to praise
my singing but the old vicar of the parish (who,
truth to tell, was too deaf to hear a note)? and
where was the pleasure of being married, if one
never by any chance saw or heard of one's husband?
It was not often, however, that I was troubled
with such discontented thoughts as these.  During
the years that had passed swiftly and happily away
since that dreadful time at Taunton, I had learned to
think of it as a sort of bad dream, so confused with
the delirium of fever, that I could scarcely separate
what was real from what was fanciful, when I tried to
recollect all that had happened in the jail; and my
remembrance of the Earl of Desmond was almost as
hazy.  I knew that he had obtained my freedom, and
thereby saved my life; for I should surely have died
in the fever but for home care and nursing, and I was
grateful accordingly; but he never came to see us,
and when I asked the reason, I was told that Sir Harry
Mountfort (who had followed the fortunes of King
James, and had taken his ward with him into France)
wished our marriage to be broken off.  My father's
poverty was one reason for this; and another was Sir
Harry's strong desire that Algernon should embrace
the Roman Catholic faith, as he himself had done.  I
never knew exactly how the breaking off was to be
managed; and though, I suppose, I was sorry, I took
as a far more personal matter the loss of our riches,
when there was a talk of selling Hebe and the other
horses, and would have given up my rank and state
with the greatest pleasure, if by doing so I could have
kept my pretty pony.  But I am forgetting my own
rule, and talking too much about things which
happened long before I entered upon my duties as a
Court lady.  My father's difficulties had ceased by
that time, Hebe was my own again, and I was the
Countess Desmond still, chiefly because Algernon had
refused to forsake his father's faith; and it was not so
easy to declare our marriage illegal whilst we both
remained members of the Church of England.  Sir
Harry Mountfort was dead, and his ward of age; but
Earl Desmond had not yet come to claim his bride.
No; at the time when the said bride, in a flutter of
shyness and delight, was making her final preparations
for her presentation to Queen Mary, her husband was
a banished man, his lands confiscated, and his life, if
he returned to England, in danger.  Algernon had
fought on the Jacobite side in the battle of the Boyne,
had served Louis the Fourteenth in the Irish Legion
afterwards, had joined in one of the numerous
conspiracies to place King James again on the English
throne, and, finally, had brought on himself the dire
displeasure of the Government by skilfully effecting
the escape of an important adherent of King James
from the Tower, where he lay under sentence of death
for high treason.  It was my father's turn now to
declare that Lord Desmond was no fit match for his
daughter; and he made the declaration very often,
and utterly refused to listen when Oliver suggested
that he might use his influence with the Government
to get Algernon's sentence of banishment reversed,
and at least some of his estates restored to him.
</p>

<p>
'"What would be the use," said Sir Bernard, "of
risking the chance of doing myself an injury, when I
feel that I have not sufficient power to be of the
slightest service to Algernon?  No; the greatest
kindness to the unhappy boy would be to make an
agreement with him to set his marriage aside, which
could easily be done, now that he and Frances are
both of age.  The law requires nothing but the
consent of both parties, which, I imagine, would be very
easily obtained, and then I would pay over to him the
dowry he was formerly to have received with his
bride, and leave him free to choose a wife for himself
among the ladies at the French Court."
</p>

<p>
'"If he can find one generous enough to follow his
fallen fortunes," muttered Oliver; adding aloud, "And
what is to become of her little Ladyship?  Surely
it is rather hard for her to come down from her
pedestal, and be plain Mistress Frances Dalrymple
once more!"
</p>

<p>
'"How long do you suppose she will remain Mistress
Frances Dalrymple?" asked my father, with his
grave, set smile.  "Rely upon me to study what is
best for my daughter's happiness, sir, and find some
better employment than that of dictating to your
elders what course of action is best for them to
pursue."
</p>

<p>
'I was not present during this conversation, but
Oliver told me all about it afterwards, and how
completely he had failed in his attempt in Algernon's
favour.
</p>

<p>
'"Perhaps you might have persuaded my father
better, Frances," he said, "but you would not come
forward.  You might have a chance even now if you
had the courage, for I am sure that, if he would,
he could help Algernon; but I begin to doubt
whether you are very anxious to help him, after all."
</p>

<p>
'I shook my head doubtfully at the idea of my
appealing to Sir Bernard.
</p>

<p>
'"You want," continued Oliver, "to turn the heads
of all the Court gallants before you bestow your
foolish little heart upon anybody.  Is that it?  I
have no patience with you.  But women are all
alike!"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, Oliver," I cried, colouring crimson at such
an accusation, "it's not that."  But Oliver was vexed,
and would not listen to my hesitating attempt at an
explanation, and marched indignantly out of the
room, slamming the door behind him.
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, what dolts men are sometimes!" said I to
myself, with an impatient little stamp of my foot on
the ground.  "Why can't he understand that Earl
Desmond would most likely far rather have my dowry,
and be rid of me altogether?  Why, he has never
seen me since I was a little girl, and I do not think I
made a great impression on him then."  I laughed as
I remembered the conversation we had had on our
wedding day, and my confident assurances to my
bridegroom that we could not be unmarried again if
we wished it ever so much.  "Supposing he does
wish it," I thought, "if I could persuade my father to
intercede for him, and he should get back his estates
through our means, he would feel bound to take me
along with them, out of gratitude to the family.  I
could not bear that."  But after all he was my husband.
He had saved my life, and I ought, in common
gratitude, to do something to help him now he was
poor and friendless.  Oliver said I ought.  I wondered
what it would be right to do; and the tears started
to my eyes, as the thought of how mamma would
have counselled me, and made everything clear and
plain to my understanding, rose to my mind.  Alas!
I could no longer go to her with every trouble or
pleasure.  In the way that lay before me, I must
learn to guide my own steps aright, and to follow as
well as I could the course she would have approved,
while knowing all the time that I should never hear
her voice in praise or blame again.  It was now two
years since we had lost her, and home had never
seemed like home since.  It was more lonely for
me than for any of the others; for Miles was at
Oxford, Roger at Eton, and Oliver, my chief friend
and companion, had received his commission, and
was burning to join the army in Flanders, and share
in the honours our troops were winning there.  With
him away, my life at Horsemandown would be
desolate indeed; and so I think there was some
excuse for me if my head was a little turned by the
change in my prospects.  "After all," said I, drying
my eyes as my meditations came to an end, "it is of no
use thinking about it.  Oliver thinks, because my father
is so gentle and kind to me, that I have more power
with him than he has; but I know quite well that
nothing I could say in Algernon's favour would make
any difference when he has once made up his mind.
If my Lord Desmond wanted his wife, he should not
have mixed himself up with those wicked conspiracies
against our good King.  'Tis his own doing if he
never sees my face again; and if he prefers my
dowry to me, he is most welcome to it, as far as I am
concerned."  But as I ran up-stairs to inspect the
preparations for my journey to London, I found
myself wondering whether the French ladies were
very beautiful&mdash;fairer than that face I caught a glimpse
of as I passed a mirror in the withdrawing-room&mdash;and
whether, if Lord Desmond was to see me&mdash;&mdash;  But
here I stopped, with a laugh at my own vanity;
and having by this time arrived at my chamber door,
I succeeded, by a violent effort, in banishing him
from my mind, and was able to give undivided
attention to the important question of the trimming
of my shaded lutestring gown.  Should the ruffles be
of Flanders or guipure lace? and what colour should
I choose for the bows of my new cornette cap?

'Queen Mary's Court was not considered a gay one
by those who remembered Whitehall during the last
reign; but to me, who had never seen any town
larger than Taunton, the life of a maid of honour
seemed a whirl of gaiety.  State balls, receptions,
visits to the play-houses, and attendance on Her
Majesty whenever she went into public!  All these I
enjoyed extremely.  Even to learn the various little
ceremonial observances which my position required
was amusing enough at first.  The Queen, my
mistress, was gentle and kind; and having got over
my first alarm at her exceedingly dignified manner,
I became, like most of her ladies, very heartily fond of
her.  Even when Whitehall was deserted for the
comparative quiet of Hampton Court, I was not dull.
The loss of the theatres and the Mall was more than
compensated for by the purer air, the greater freedom
from restraint, and the merry hunting and hawking
parties which were carried on when the season
permitted.  I had plenty of employment, companions of
my own age, and more compliments and admiration
than I had ever received in my life before.  No
wonder the thought of Algernon faded more and more
out of my mind now there was no Oliver to talk about
and pity him.  I never even heard myself called by
his name.  It was not a popular one at that Court,
and my father had ordained that I should be received
there as his daughter, not as the wife of an exiled
Jacobite.  To all intents and purposes I was free,
and might, if I chose, carry on as many love affairs as
Lady Beatrice Falkland herself, the fairest and most
coquettish of all her Majesty's waiting-women.
</p>

<p>
'But I see you think I am telling a very dull, long,
rambling story, so I will not trouble you with a
minute description of our way of life at Hampton
Court.  You would not care to hear how many hours
I and my companions spent every morning working
the life of Moses in tent-stitch, under the direction of
the Queen herself; and you would be more shocked
than interested to be told of the amount of time and
money we wasted every evening at the card-tables,
absorbed in the fascination of Ombre, Basset, or
Spadille.  I will pass on at once to an event which
was very interesting to me, and which I hope,
therefore, will prove so to you.
</p>

<p>
'One day, about six months after my arrival at
the Palace, I was sitting in my own chamber in a
very melancholy frame of mind.  News had been
received that morning of a great victory gained over
the French in Flanders.  Great were the rejoicings of
the Court in consequence; but the messenger who
had brought the tidings, and who had quite a budget
of letters from absent husbands and brothers to their
relations in the Palace, had none for me.  I was just
making up my mind that Oliver was either badly
wounded or killed outright&mdash;for I knew his company
had been engaged several times&mdash;when a tap at the
door aroused me from my dismal conjectures, and
Lady Beatrice Falkland, without waiting for
permission, tripped into the room.
</p>

<p>
'"Your pardon, Mistress Frances, for my want of
ceremony," she said; "but I knew you would fret
about your brother till you brought on a fit of the
vapours, if you were left alone, love, so I made bold
to storm your fortress, and come in.  Why, child, you
are not the only one who has had no news.  Do you
suppose officers have nothing else to do the instant a
battle is over but sit down and write long letters
home?  I have not had a line from my father since
he landed at the Hague; but I am not going to cry
my eyes out, and imagine all kinds of disasters, just
because of that.  I'll wager all my winnings last night
that Mr. Dalrymple is alive and merry at this present
moment.  So cheer up, my dear, and listen to me;
I've something very important to tell you."
</p>

<p>
'Lady Beatrice was so good-natured and light-hearted
herself, that she raised one's spirits whether
one would or no.  I forgot my worst fears while
listening to her cheerful voice, and was able, by the
time she had finished speaking, to smile and ask, with
some show of interest, what the very important
matter was.
</p>

<p>
'"Important to you, I suppose you mean, Beatrice?
I don't feel as if anything was of much importance to
me now, except news of Oliver, and that I know you
cannot have got."
</p>

<p>
'"You don't know anything of the sort, my dear,"
replied her Ladyship mischievously.  "Perhaps I have,
and perhaps I have not.  There, don't look so wild.
You shan't hear the story at all unless you let me tell
it in my own way."
</p>

<p>
'I leant back in my chair, sighing impatiently; and
Lady Beatrice went on:
</p>

<p>
'"You know that yesterday the Lady Derby, one
or two others, and myself, went up to London to see
the merry-making at St. James's Fair.  My Lord
Chamberlain escorted us, and as he was the only
gentleman, he nearly ruined himself in buying fairings
for us all.  Oh! we had the merriest day, I assure
you, I ever spent.  I wish you had been there.  However,
if you had, I should not have met with the little
adventure I am about to relate to you.  It would have
fallen to your share.  Ah, you have no idea of what
you missed!  I must show you the shoe-buckles; they
are of a new design, and very elegant.  But to return
to the stranger gallant I was talking about."
</p>

<p>
'"Why, Beatrice, how you run on!  You have not
got to any gallant at all, except the Lord Chamberlain."
</p>

<p>
'"Had I not?  Well, listen then.  As we got out
of our coach at St. James's Gate, I dropped my
kerchief.  I turned back to look for it, and so was one
minute behind the others.  The Lord Chamberlain
was so busy protecting the ladies through the crowd
that he never missed me, and by the time I had
found what I wanted, they were quite out of
sight.  I was beginning to get frightened, when, by
good luck, a strange gentleman came forward, and
offered very politely to escort me to my friends.  Of
course I was very thankful to him for his courtesy (for
I am sure I could never have faced the rabble by
myself), and we found the rest again before we had
gone many steps.  But this was not all.  Lady Derby
rebuked me so roundly for loitering and speaking to
a stranger, that I did not dare tell her what
happened afterwards.  We met some gentlemen of our
acquaintance in the fair, and while the others were
talking to them, I said I would go and choose a fairing
for you.  I was looking at these same shoe-buckles,
when up came the strange gentleman again, bowed
very low, and, addressing me by my name, asked
whether I would pardon his rudeness in speaking to
me, and do him the great favour of pointing out which
among my friends was Mistress Frances Dalrymple.
We all had our black vizards on, you know; so how
he found out who I was passes my comprehension.
He seemed sorely disappointed when I told him you
were not there; and as he had been so civil, I could
not help saying that you were a great friend of mine,
and that I would, if he pleased, bear you any message
he chose to send."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, Beatrice, how could you be so giddy?" I
began reproachfully, but she interrupted me.
</p>

<p>
'"Nay, do but hear me out, and you shall scold me
as much as you like afterwards.  He told me that he
knew your brother very well; that he had seen him
lately, and had tidings from him which could only be
delivered to your private ear."
</p>

<p>
'"From Oliver!  Who can it be?" I said wonderingly,
becoming much interested, though still rather
doubtful.  "But pray, if he wants to see me, why
cannot he go to my father in a straightforward way, and
ask for a proper introduction?"
</p>

<p>
'"He said it was impossible," replied Beatrice;
"that there were reasons which he was sure you
would approve which made secrecy absolutely
necessary; that he had a token from your brother
which would prove to you at once that he was speaking
the truth.  And so&mdash;in fact, he looked so pitiful,
that&mdash;that&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well?" I said impatiently.
</p>

<p>
'"Well," she continued, "I arranged that he should
have a private interview with you here in the Palace."
</p>

<p>
'"With me! without asking my consent first!
Really, Beatrice, this is too much.  Your thoughtlessness
passes belief.  How could you promise such a
thing to a total stranger?  Why, I do not even know
the man's name!"
</p>

<p>
'"He said his name was Carroll, I think," replied
Lady Beatrice demurely, but looking nevertheless
mischievously delighted at my vexation; "and as to
being a perfect stranger, why, he was as anxious to
see you as if he had known you all his life."
</p>

<p>
"I will not see him," I said indignantly.  "No
gentleman would try to obtain an interview with a
lady without her own permission; and yet, if he really
has news of Oliver&mdash;&mdash;!  Oh, Beatrice, what shall I
do?"
</p>

<p>
'But Beatrice would do nothing but laugh at my
perplexities, and declare that I was as discreet and
formal in my ideas as Lady Derby herself.
</p>

<p>
'"Conceive the Countess's horror," she said, "if it
ever came to her ears that Mistress Frances Dalrymple,
the most discreet, well-behaved damsel in the Palace,
had had a secret interview with a mysterious stranger
under her very nose!  Oh, I would give anything to
see her face when she found it out!"  And Beatrice
went into another fit of laughter, from which she
recovered with some difficulty, and went on: "Seriously,
Frances, you ought to be very much obliged to me for
taking all this trouble to procure you news from your
brother.  Why, only half an hour ago you were in
despair because you had not heard from him."
</p>

<p>
'"But then, why all this secrecy?" I objected
again, though rather more faintly.
</p>

<p>
'"Pshaw, child, how suspicious you are!  There
may be twenty reasons for that.  The gentleman may
be in debt; he may have killed his antagonist in a
duel; or suppose he should be your brother himself,
in some dreadful difficulty or danger, come home to
see you in disguise!"
</p>

<p>
'"Oh, if I thought that!" I cried, starting up.
"But it is too improbable; and yet I don't know
Oliver is so very rash and hasty, he might have
involved himself in some serious trouble, and be afraid
of applying to my father; but then it could not be
safe for him to come here."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! now you are getting something more
reasonable, so I will tell you what I have arranged.
Truth to tell, the gentleman did want me to promise
that you should meet him in the park early this morning,
but I thought I never should be able to make you
agree to that; for it did not strike me till this moment
that he might be only your brother after all.  Do you
know, Frances, I shall be quite disappointed if he is;
it spoils my little romance completely."
</p>

<p>
'"Hush! oh, hush!  It must be Oliver.  Why did
I not think of it before?  Tell me quick, when am I
to see him, and where?  And are you sure he will
not be discovered?  I cannot think how you have
contrived it."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah! that is my affair.  Do you suppose I have
never managed a secret meeting before now?  But
don't look so frightened.  Not a soul in the Palace
will be the wiser for Mr. Carroll's comings and goings.
He is to be a haberdasher, come to shew you some
new stuffs for your dress at the masquerade next
week.  One of the pages of the back-stairs, on whom
I can depend, will conduct him here, and will answer
any questions that are asked about him.  What
o'clock was that&mdash;four?  He will be here directly."
</p>

<p>
'"Directly?  Oh, Beatrice!  I had no idea it was
to be so soon.  Why did you not tell me all this
earlier?"
</p>

<p>
'For all reply, Beatrice held up her hand and listened.
</p>

<p>
'"Hark! he is coming.  I hear footsteps along the
gallery.  Farewell, Frances.  I must not spoil the
<i>tête-à-tête</i>.  I shall vanish through this door as
Mr. Carroll is coming in at the other."
</p>

<p>
'And she was as good as her word, in spite of my
despairing attempt to catch her hand, and my hurried
whisper of "Pray don't go," as my first glance at the
face of the stranger assured me that he was not Oliver
after all.  The page who had announced Mr. Carroll
withdrew, after a low bow, and I was left alone with
my strange visitor.  I was so confused by his sudden
entrance, and by the conversation I had just been
having with Beatrice, that the self-possession my six
months' sojourn at Court had taught me entirely
evaporated; and it was not until I had finished a
most profound courtesy, in return for an equally
elaborate salutation from Mr. Carroll, that I ventured once
more to look him in the face.  No, it was not Oliver.
No amount of disguise could have changed his blue
eyes into brown ones, or altered his well-remembered
features into those I saw before me.  The gentleman
was entirely unknown to me, I felt certain; and with
this thought came back my resentment at his
unwarrantable intrusion.  So I summoned up my dignity
with a great effort, and said, "The Lady Beatrice
Falkland has informed me that you have tidings of
my brother to give me, sir.  I trust he was safe and
well when you last saw him?"
</p>

<p>
'"I am speaking then to Lady Desmond?" asked
Mr. Carroll eagerly, and with such a peculiar emphasis
on the name as made me give an involuntary start.
"Pardon me, madam.  I should have said Mistress
Frances Dalrymple; but your brother always speaks
of you by your husband's name, and so has taught
me to do the same."
</p>

<p>
'"My father wishes me to be called so," I said
(wondering at the same time why I was making this
explanation to a stranger, and much confused by
the knowledge that my visitor's eyes had scarcely
left my face since he entered the room), "and I am
becoming so used to it, that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"I understand," said Mr. Carroll, in a slow, quiet
tone, which contrasted strangely with his former
hurried, excited manner.  "You are beginning to forget
that you ever bore any other?  Well, no doubt it is
best that it should be so.  Sir Bernard's policy has
succeeded well.  But I crave your pardon once more,"
he continued, as I coloured with surprise and
embarrassment.  "You are longing for news of your brother,
and are justly wondering what right I have to allude
to your private concerns.  Perhaps, when you have
read these letters, you will forgive me for forcing my
presence on you; and if you do not, why, I will never
trouble you with it again."
</p>

<p>
'I held out my hand eagerly for the packet, overjoyed
at the sight of Oliver's well-known handwriting;
but something in the tone of Mr. Carroll's voice made
me pause and cast a puzzled, anxious glance at him
before I opened my letter.  He half smiled as his
eyes met mine; and instantly such a flood of misty,
bewildering recollections rushed across my mind, that
I was obliged to cover my face with my hands and
wonder vaguely where I was, before I could find voice
enough to ask the question which was trembling on
my lips.  The large drawing-room at Horsemandown
rose clear and distinct before me.  I seemed to feel
once more mamma's hand on my shoulder, pressing
me forward, and to hear Sir Harry Mountfort's loud,
jovial voice introducing, with mock formality, to
Mistress Frances Dalrymple her future bridegroom,
the Earl of Desmond.  Was I dreaming?  "Could it
really be?" I began to ask myself.  But before I had
time to finish the sentence, or courage to look up,
Mr. Carroll had made two steps forward, taken my hands
in his, and said, "Frances, do you know me?" in a
tone of such wistful anxiety, that I was compelled to
answer.
</p>

<p>
'"Are you really Algernon?&mdash;I mean my Lord
Desmond?" I stammered out, not because I doubted
any longer, but because, in the entanglement of my
ideas, I could think of nothing better to say.
</p>

<p>
'"I am indeed.  Have I frightened you very
much?" he exclaimed earnestly, as with crimson
cheeks and beating heart I withdrew my hands, and
sank into a chair.  "Forgive me, madam.  I have
been too abrupt.  I did not intend to part with my
secret till you had been prepared for it by your
brother's letter."
</p>

<p>
'"Oh no, I am not frightened, only very, very much
surprised," I faltered.  "I did not know it was safe for
you to come to England.  I never thought of seeing
you here."
</p>

<p>
'"It is not safe," he replied carelessly.  "I am
entirely in your power.  If you choose to betray me, or
if your friend does not keep our counsel very
rigorously, I should be committed to the Tower without
fail, and most likely share the fate of many a one
before me.  But I am not afraid.  I know enough of
Oliver to feel sure that his sister could not be
treacherous, even had I no claim on her but that of her
brother's friendship."
</p>

<p>
'"Surely not," I said eagerly.  "But oh! there
must be many other chances of discovery.  What
could make you run such a fearful risk?"
</p>

<p>
'"You would not think so much of the risk if you
had been in peril of your life as often as I have," said
Lord Desmond, with a smile which recalled to me
my bridegroom of eleven years ago.  "I have been
employed in so many hazardous intrigues, and have
had so many hair-breadth escapes, that for the life of
me I cannot feel as alarmed about my fate as I used
to be.  As to my reason for coming, you shall hear
that presently, when you have read your brother's
letter, which will show you that I had his authority
at least for obtaining an interview with you, and as
much help as he could give me in contriving it."
</p>

<p>
'I broke the seal and tried to read, but my mind
refused to take in the sense of the words.  I could
think of nothing but the wonderful discovery I had
made; and after gazing absently at the paper for
about a minute, I put it down to say, "How did you
meet Oliver?  I thought you were in France.  I don't
seem to understand anything yet."
</p>

<p>
'"It was," replied Lord Desmond, "at a chocolate
house at the Hague that I saw him first.  He had
been sent to the Government there with despatches
from the generals in Flanders.  I&mdash;well!&mdash;I had
private business there connected with the affairs of
His Majesty at St. Germains.  I heard your brother's
name mentioned accidentally, sought him out at his
lodgings, and made myself known.  I could not resist
the temptation of finding out how I stood with you all,
though, as a Jacobite and an exile, I know I had no
right to expect any countenance from an officer in
King William's army.  Oliver was most generous and
kind, greeted me as warmly as if we had been brothers
indeed, and declared that he had long been hoping
that chance would bring us together again.  That
meeting altered all my plans for the future.  Before
that I had been frittering away my time at St. Germains,
seeing plot after plot for bringing the King
back to his rights fail; and at last, when I found
assassination and treachery were to be the means
employed for his restoration, almost resolving to
renounce politics altogether, enter some foreign
service where I should not be obliged to fight against
England, and so push my way up to distinction.  The
King's cause seemed to me hopeless after the affair
of La Hogue.  I could do him no good by living on
at his Court as a pensioner on his bounty, and I was
wearied to death with the splendour, the bustle,
the squabbles and jealousies of Versailles and
St. Germains.  It was just when I had made up my
mind to this that I received a letter from Sir Bernard
Dalrymple.  You know the proposal it contained?"
</p>

<p>
'"I knew he purposed writing to you, but I did
not know he had actually done so," I said in
surprise.
</p>

<p>
'"Indeed! then your brother was right after all.
I was convinced, from what Sir Bernard said, that
you, as well as he, wished to break off all connection
between us.  I did not wonder, for I saw that it was
hard for you to be bound for life to a man without
fortune, friends, or position; and I should certainly
have taken your father at his word, and have allowed
him to try all the means in his power to break off our
marriage and leave you free, had it not been for the
sight of Oliver's face in that Dutch coffee-house.  It
reminded me, somehow, of your mother, and of your
home at Horsemandown, where everything looked
bright and cheerful, and you all so much happier than
I had ever been.  I really believe it was his likeness
to her which made me suddenly resolve to find out
where he lived, and try if he would remember our old
friendship."
</p>

<p>
'Here Lord Desmond paused a moment, but, as I
did not speak, he went on.  "You cannot imagine,"
he said, "what Oliver's kindness was to me.  I had
been so long alone in the world, that to be treated as if
belonging to his family, to be told of all that had
befallen them since last we met, as if he was sure of
my sympathy and interest, was wonderfully strange
and pleasant to me.  And then he talked of you so
fondly and proudly; he was so certain that you knew
nothing of Sir Bernard's ambitious schemes in
connection with your marriage (rumours of which had
reached the gossiping little Court of St. Germains);
he was so indignant at your father's letter;&mdash;that I
began to have a faint, wild hope that you might think
like him; that, perhaps, if&mdash;&mdash;  In short, I determined,
at all hazard, to see you once more, to hear your own
wishes from your own lips, and not to give your
father an answer, one way or another, until I should
know them."
</p>

<p>
'My wishes!  What were they?  Half an hour
before I should have declared unhesitatingly for
freedom; not for the sake of making a grand marriage,
but that I might continue my present careless, butterfly
life, looking forward no further than to the days
when Oliver should have returned from the wars,
when we should all be together again, and pay a
happy visit to Horsemandown.  But now, when my
eyes were full of tears at hearing Oliver spoken of by
one who seemed to care for him almost as much as I
did&mdash;when Lord Desmond's allusion to my mother
had brought back to me the remembrance of the
words she had used when she first told me I was to
be married: "Remember, Frances, you are about to
make a vow you will one day be called on to fulfil"&mdash;now
everything was changed.  What could I feel but
pity for him, and self-reproach for my own
hard-hearted conduct in refusing all help to Oliver, when
he had tried his utmost to influence my father in
Algernon's favour?  But I would make up for that
now.  I would use all the power I possessed to
persuade my father to intercede with the King; and
if that failed, I would petition the Queen myself for
a reversal of the sentence of banishment.  I would
do anything and everything to show my brother's
friend that I was not the ambitious, calculating
woman of the world he had pictured to himself.  I
would justify Oliver's trust in me, and then&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"I am very sorry, Frances&mdash;I must come in,"
said the voice of Beatrice at the door, before I had
time to say one word aloud in answer to Lord
Desmond's appeal.  "I have knocked three times,
and have had no answer.  The Queen commands
your attendance in her cabinet immediately.  She
asked where you were; and when I replied with my
little fiction about the haberdasher and the new
stuffs, Lady Derby was seized with a desire to come
and see them; so I ran on before to warn Mr. Carroll
to make good his escape by the back-stairs before
she arrives, unless he has bethought him of bringing
some brocades and satins with him to bear out his
supposed character."
</p>

<p>
'I started up in a tremor of agitation and dismay.
"Oh, go! make haste; you will be discovered.  She
will be here directly."
</p>

<p>
"'I must see you again; but where?" said Lord
Desmond, in a low voice, grasping the hand I held
out to him as if he never meant to let it go.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, yes, you shall.  Come to the gardens&mdash;to
the hornbeam walk they call Queen Mary's Bower&mdash;it
will be safer than here&mdash;to-morrow at eight, when
Her Majesty is at supper," replied Beatrice rapidly,
as, confused and helpless, I looked to her for a
suggestion.
</p>

<p>
'"You promise?" eagerly asked Algernon.
</p>

<p>
'"Yes, I promise," I repeated after him, in as
steady a tone as my fright would permit.
</p>

<p>
'He hurriedly raised my hand to his lips, bowed
low to Beatrice, and quitted the room without any
further delay.  It was not one moment too soon.
Beatrice had barely time to close the door behind
him and execute a little pirouette, expressive of
satisfaction and relief, when Lady Derby entered by the
opposite door, in a state of displeased surprise at my
non-appearance in the Queen's cabinet.  What
excuses Beatrice made for me, and how I managed to
go through the usual routine of duties for the rest
of the day, I do not now remember.  I was in a sort
of dream the whole time, thinking over all that Lord
Desmond had told me, building fantastic castles in
the air, and impatiently longing for night, when I
might be alone again, and read Oliver's letter in
peace and quietness.  The afternoon promenade had
never seemed so irksome, nor supper such an endless
business before.  At cards I did not know whether
my fortune was good or bad until I was told, and
received the announcement of my losses so placidly,
that I was complimented on the sweetness of my
temper.  I cannot say there was much sweetness left in
it by the time bedtime came.  Early as the hour was at
which the Household retired to rest, I felt as if it
never would come.  When, however, at last ten
o'clock struck, and the Queen had been attended
with the usual formalities to her bed-chamber, and all
the ceremonious "good-nights" had been said,
Beatrice Falkland put her arm into mine as I turned
towards my own room, and begged me to take pity
on her, for she was dying of curiosity to know who
the mysterious Mr. Carroll really was, and what his
business with me.  Of course I told her everything,
and the story was sufficiently out of the common
way to satisfy even he: appetite for romance.
</p>

<p>
'"My dear Frances," she said, "I vow it is exactly
like the plot of the last play we went to see.  A cruel
father! a lover in disguise! a secret meeting!  All
<i>en regie</i>; only I believe that the hero in the piece
had stabbed the heroine's brother, or poisoned her
uncle, or committed some crime of that sort.  'Tis
rather a pity that you are already married.  It spoils the
dramatic 'situation.'  Now, own yourself grateful to
me for my address in managing this little adventure
for you.  You would never have consented to see
that poor, despairing, handsome Mr. Carroll, if I had
given you any choice in the matter."
</p>

<p>
'But the subject appeared too serious for more
than a very faint smile at Beatrice's extravagances;
and when she rushed with much zest into a description
of the various stratagems necessary for the
management of my promised interview in Queen Mary's
Bower, I became alarmed and bewildered at the
prospect of what I had undertaken.  I could not enjoy
the concealment and mystery as she seemed to do,
and, moreover, I was very doubtful of my power of so
keeping my secret that no one in the Palace should
suspect me of having one.  Had it not been for my
promise to Lord Desmond, and my desire to prove to
him that I too could be generous and disinterested, I
really believe I should have given up the fulfilment of
the appointment altogether.  But it was too late for
that.  So I let Beatrice talk on till she had fairly
tired herself out; and when at last she departed, I
gave a sigh of relief, and, snatching the precious
letter from my pocket, prepared to get what
comfort I could from the closely written pages.
Oliver's warm praises of his friend, and his assurance
that I should soon learn to care for Algernon as
much as he did, made me smile and blush a little; and
when he told me all that he had gradually learnt
of Lord Desmond's utter friendlessness and poverty&mdash;of
how, in spite of the services he had rendered the
King, he was barely tolerated at the Court of St. Germains,
on account of the difference of his religion&mdash;of
how he had indignantly rejected the proposal of
receiving my dowry as the price of the resignation of
his bride&mdash;my doubt and despondency melted away
entirely, and I resolved, more firmly than ever, to help him.
</p>

<p>
'But that meeting in Queen Mary's Bower, which I
thought of all the next morning with a mixture of
feelings impossible to describe, never took place after
all.  Long before the appointed hour arrived, the
news had spread through the Palace that the
banished Earl of Desmond had been discovered in
disguise, lurking in the neighbourhood of Hampton
Court, apprehended, and sent off to the Tower.
Beatrice brought me the tidings, looking scared and
horrified&mdash;as well she might: for to be sent to the
Tower on the charge of conspiring against the
Government was a prelude to certain death in case of
the prisoner being found guilty; and Lord Desmond's
name had so long been connected with the Jacobitical
plots, that there was little chance of the accusation,
falling to the ground for lack of witnesses and
proofs.  But if Beatrice was distressed, I was
perfectly dumb with horror.  Was this to be the end of
all my brilliant plans for gaining Lord Desmond's
pardon, and then recalling him from exile and
obscurity to the enjoyment of "his own again"&mdash;the
produce of my own exertions and entreaties?  Was
he no longer to have even the wretched alternative of
death, and the life of banishment and poverty of
which he was so weary?  Oh, why had he been so
mad as to risk his liberty for the sake of seeing me
for a few minutes?  And what an unsatisfactory
interview it had been!  "He does not even know
the answer I meant to have given him," I cried in
despair.  "I daresay he thinks me a mercenary,
heartless, unfeeling wretch, and that his arrest is of
my contriving.  Oh, Beatrice, what shall I do?"  But
though I asked the question, I knew that I might
as well expect counsel from a humming-bird, or a
butterfly, as from Beatrice.
</p>

<p>
'No one could be more bright and ready in managing
the little intrigues and adventures in which she
delighted.  But the present emergency was much too
serious for her; and she could only cry and caress
me, put on a very pretty air of penitence for her
share in bringing about our misfortunes, and suggest
schemes of rescue and flight which could only succeed
on the stage, and which, even there, would have
been scouted by a critical audience.  I could not
help giving a somewhat derisive smile at her very
wild schemes, and then sat trying to collect my
thoughts, and decide what course of action I had
better take first.  Something must be done, and that
speedily.  But what?  Would it be best to explain
everything to the Queen, and entrust Algernon's
safety to her kind heart and merciful interference? or
should I rush to my father, who was in
London, absorbed in parliamentary business, and
bespeak his influence and aid, as if I had no more
doubt of his will than of his power to be of
assistance to his son-in-law?
</p>

<p>
'"You had better go and ask the advice of
your friend the Baroness Von Hoogstraaten, if you
only laugh at mine," said Beatrice, pretending to pout,
though she was too good-natured to be really angry.
</p>

<p>
'"So I would, if she was but here," I answered,
sighing.  "Henrietta is so wise and clear-headed,
she would be sure to know what would be best."
</p>

<p>
'"Did you not know," replied Beatrice, "that
she had come back from Gloucestershire?  She will be
at the reception this afternoon; so you can consult
with her as much as you please."
</p>

<p>
'This was good news for me; for Henrietta
Sidney, now the wife of a Dutch nobleman, one of
the King's most tried and trusted friends, was still
as much as ever what I liked to call her, my elder
sister, who laughed at me for my little vanities,
shook her head when I did anything especially foolish,
and whom I loved and admired as much as in the days
when our friendship first began in the prison at Taunton.
</p>

<p>
'I used to see her very often when she was at her
own house, near Hampton, but of late she had been
visiting her father; and I, left to my own devices and
management, felt that I certainly had not improved
in judgment and discretion since we parted.  Impatient
as I was, however, to pour out all my troubles to
her, I was obliged to wait till the next day to do so,
for the reception was an unusually crowded one.  The
Baroness von Hoogstraaten had many acquaintances,
and, moreover, she was a great favourite with the
Queen, who talked to her so long about the buildings
that were being added to the Palace, and the improvements
in the gardens, that I had no time to do more
than greet her very warmly, and tell her, with a very
rueful expression in my looks, how much I wanted
to see her in private.
</p>

<p>
'"Her Majesty has given you permission to come
and breakfast with me to-morrow, Frances," she said,
smiling at my dismal countenance; "so you must
keep your budget of Court gossip till then.  It must
be a full one, to judge by your eager face."
</p>

<p>
'But I could not return the smile; and as I
felt rather hurt at the allusion to Court "gossip," I
felt a gloomy satisfaction in allowing Henrietta to
depart under the impression that something very
dreadful indeed had happened, rather hoping she
would pass a sleepless night in trying to find out
what it could possibly be.  But when I met her next
morning in her own garden, where she was superintending
the fanciful clipping of the yew-trees Baron
Hoogstraten loved, I saw that she knew already part
at least of what I had to tell.
</p>

<p>
'"Forgive me, dear, for my little joke yesterday,"
she said.  "Now I know that poor Lord Desmond is
a prisoner in the Tower, I understand your troubled
look well enough."
</p>

<p>
'"Ah, but you don't know all!" I said in a
trembling voice, "Now listen, Henrietta, and give
me all the help you can.  I am half-distracted
with trying to think what I had best do; for save
Lord Desmond's life I must, and I know not how
to set about it."
</p>

<p>
'I told my story without interruption, for
Henrietta was never in a great hurry to express her
own opinions; and we walked the whole length of
the terrace, after I had finished, without her
uttering a word.  When we had reached the end of the
long, straight path, she stopped, and said in her
gentle, considerate voice&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'"Frances, dear, before I promise anything, I
want you to answer me one question.  Supposing
it possible to gain Lord Desmond's pardon, as I
hope and trust it may be, is his wife prepared to
follow him into the exile and poverty I fear will
still be his? or does she only want to pay the debt
of gratitude she has owed so long, and be free?"
</p>

<p>
'"I don't know&mdash;I don't know anything," I said,
beginning to sob helplessly.  "Oh, Henrietta, save
him first, and we can settle everything else afterwards."
</p>

<p>
'Henrietta put her arm round my waist, and drew
me towards the house, saying, as if I had given the
most lucid and sensible answer in the world:
</p>

<p>
'"Then come with me, dear, for there is no time to
be lost.  Lord Desmond's trial is to take place in a
week; but if you are brave and patient, I THINK
HE CAN BE SAVED."'
</p>

<p>
Uncle Algernon stopped here for a moment, and
then said: 'The rest of the story must be told in Lord
Desmond's words, for it concerns him even more
nearly than his wife; and, besides, it really is his turn
now: her Ladyship has had a great deal more than
her fair share in the narrative.'

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br><br>
UNCLE ALGERNON'S LAST STORY.
</h3>

<p>
Some hours after my incursion into the
Palace of Hampton Court, I was wandering
about under the chestnut-trees in
Bushy Park.  I had been loitering there all
that hot summer afternoon, watching from a distance
the brightly-dressed group that had emerged from the
Palace grounds, and crossed over the grass towards
the piece of water at the south side of the park.  I
knew that it was Queen Mary and her ladies taking
their usual afternoon stroll; and though I did not
venture so near as to see their faces, there was a certain
silver-grey gown and carnation-coloured petticoat
which I recognised directly, and which I gazed upon
with intense interest.  They hovered about by the
water-side for a while, and then strolled back again
over the grass, and re-entered the great iron gates
which separated the Palace gardens from the park.  I
watched them intently until they were out of sight;
and then, turning away, wandered through the trees
once more, until I came to the water's edge where they
had been standing.  There I stood, staring absently
down at the bright blue sky, dotted with soft flakes
of cloud, like pink shells, which lay reflected in the
water beneath me.  I was thinking of the curious
stolen interview with my wife, which I had so long
set my heart upon obtaining, and which, after all, had
been so short, hurried, and unsatisfactory.  Not that
I had been disappointed in her&mdash;no, indeed, far from
it!  Oliver's description had in some degree prepared
me for her unusual beauty.  I remembered, too, how
Sir Harry used to prophesy that she would some day
be a lovely woman; and the first glance told me that
his prophecy had been a true one.  Among all the many
lovely faces that I had seen at the Hague, at
St. Germains, even at the Court of Louis XIV. himself, not
one was there which I thought so beautiful as hers.
Besides the clearly cut features, the sparkling,
mischievous hazel eyes, and brilliant yet delicate
complexion, there was a peculiar expression, arch, bright,
and what the French would call <i>malin</i>, and yet at the
same time very sweet and thoughtful&mdash;a look which
I had never seen in any other face but that of my
friend Oliver.  No, it was not that I was disappointed
in Frances, but that I wanted to have seen more of
her&mdash;to have found out what her real wishes were, and
whether they went with those of her father or of her
brother.  That question was a very difficult one to
answer; for she had spoken but little, and the anxiety
which she had shown on account of my peril, and the
tears that rose in her eyes as she listened to my story,
were doubtless simply because I was the friend of her
favourite brother.  How could I expect her to feel
anything like cordiality towards a husband whom she
had seen but once in her life, and that for a single day,
more than eleven years ago? a husband, too, without
home or fortune, who was living with a sword over his
head, and to be rid of whom was well known to be the
heart's desire of her father?  I stood pondering these
things on the water's brink till the sun had set; and
when I roused myself at last, I was quite amazed to
find that the statue of Diana on the fountain in the
middle of the water had become only a dusky outline
against the sky, and the wreaths of rose-coloured cloud
had turned into one heavy leaden bank upon the
horizon.  It was clearly time to turn my steps towards
Kingston, where I had been lodging for the last few
days.
</p>

<p>
'So I sauntered leisurely towards the nearest gate
of the park.  A dark figure was moving about under
a clump of chestnut-trees close at hand; but, as I
came near, it vanished suddenly, and I passed on,
thinking that it was most likely a startled deer.  But
just as I was turning out of the gate, there was a
stealthy footstep behind me, and I paused to look
back.  One moment more and a hand was laid upon
my shoulder, and I heard the fatal words:
</p>

<p>
'"You are arrested in the King's name."
</p>

<p>
'My hand was on my sword in an instant, but I
had not time to draw it.  Several more figures had
already rushed through the gateway.  My arms were
held down, my sword unfastened, and I was dragged
out of Bushy Park a prisoner.
</p>

<p>
'I need not say how bitter and desponding were the
thoughts that filled my mind that night during our
dark voyage up the Thames, on our way to the Tower.
In a few hours I was about to pass through the
Traitor's Gate; and I knew well, when I considered
my case soberly, how very slender was my chance of
leaving the Tower again, except for the scaffold.
There was only one person in England who might
perhaps speak a word in my behalf; and even if for
her brother's sake she should take the trouble to
speak it, was it likely that her petition would be of any
use?  Would not her father throw all his power into
the opposite scale?  Besides, I felt that my offences
against King William were far too great and too
notorious to be forgiven.  My fate was sealed, and
through my own desperate rashness.
</p>

<p>
'There was an end now of the meeting in Queen
Mary's Bower, which I had forced Frances, half
against her will, to promise me.  I wondered when
she would hear of my arrest.  For one moment the
doubt crossed my mind whether she might not
already know it&mdash;whether it could indeed be possible
that she had betrayed the secret of my visit to the
Queen.  But no, I knew that it could not be so.  Was
she not Oliver's sister?  Had she not Oliver's truthful
eyes, and frank, honest smile?  Far more likely that
my pretty little acquaintance of St. James's Fair, the
lively, sparkling Lady Beatrice, had been babbling to
some of her companions of the matter&mdash;perhaps to
the Queen herself.  Or, after all, might not the
discovery have been made most easily through the page
who had admitted me into the Palace? or that old
Lady Derby, who so very nearly caught me in
Frances' room?  Her suspicions might have been
roused, and then doubtless she would soon manage to
come to the bottom of the whole story.  But Frances
had not betrayed me; or, if she had, it was
involuntarily, not through treachery.  I could have staked
my life upon that.  No; I had no right to blame any
one but myself.  I had been madly reckless, and I
must abide by the consequences.
</p>

<p>
'Ten days had gone by, and I knew what the price
of that morning's recklessness was to be.
</p>

<p>
'My trial was over, and my dark foreboding was
coming to pass.  Three more days I was to spend in
the Tower, and then I was to die upon the scaffold.
Not a word had I heard of Frances since the night
that I was taken prisoner; but her father had been in
court on the day of my trial, and the same night I
had received a letter from him, in which he offered to
use all his interest with the Government to gain my
pardon, but upon one condition.  I must give him my
promise to agree that my marriage with his daughter
should be dissolved.  We were now both of age, and
at liberty to break it off by mutual consent.  His
reasons for wishing this, he said, were of course clear
enough to me; and he doubted not that I should
agree without hesitation to take a course which was
plainly the best for his daughter's interests, and the
only one which gave me a hope of escape.  But Sir
Bernard said nothing of his daughter's wishes on the
subject.  If Frances really was as anxious as himself
to dissolve the marriage, surely he would have laid as
much stress as possible upon that argument.  Perhaps
he meant her to have no voice in the matter; or did
he take it for granted that her wishes were the same
as her father's?  I rather wondered that Sir Bernard
should have chosen to interfere at all with my fortunes.
I was sentenced to death, and if I died, his daughter,
whether she was my wife or not, would of course be
free.
</p>

<p>
'When the sentence was pronounced, I had not
felt for a moment the slightest expectation that a
pardon was to be procured on any terms, and had
made up my mind to meet my fate as became a
soldier.  Still, it seemed very hard to die so
early&mdash;harder now, I fancied, than it would have been a
month ago.  Yet if my only hope of life was to give
up all claim to be Frances Dalrymple's husband!&mdash;&mdash;  No;
I could not bear to think of being released from
my engagement merely to save my own head from
the scaffold.  Honour and pride alike forbade that.
So I wrote in answer to Sir Bernard's proposal, that
if my wife could truthfully say that it was her own
unbiassed wish that the marriage should be broken
off, I was ready to give my consent; but upon that
condition alone.  I did not allude to the hopes he had
held out of using his interest with the Government on
my behalf, nor did I say anything of Oliver's friendship
with me; for somehow I shrank from the least
approach to what I considered the ignominy of pleading
for my life.  But when the letter was despatched,
and day after day passed on without a word of news
having reached my ears concerning my wife or any of
her family, I must own that I felt intensely sick at
heart.  I had been in peril of death over and over
again, but never before had it seemed so close and so
real as now.  Pain and death are not so fearful when
one only looks forward to them vaguely, as possible
at any time.  It is knowing the exact moment&mdash;feeling
that it will inevitably come, and cannot be put off
by any human power whatever&mdash;this is the ordeal
which is hard to pass through with unfaltering
courage.
</p>

<p>
'I stood at the window of my prison, gazing out on
the river below.  Escape was utterly out of the
question.  My exploit two years ago, when I triumphantly
bore off my friend Will Delamere from the Tower,
was too well remembered to leave the remotest chance
for me of repeating that feat on my own account!
Besides, I had no fellow-conspirator outside the walls.
Will could never have done it alone.  Oh, if Oliver
did but know of my danger!  Not that he could
really have done anything to help me, but I should at
least have had one friend to stand by me during these
last few days of my life.  But Oliver would hear
nothing of my fate till all was over.  This trouble
must be gone through unflinchingly, without one soul
who cared about me to say a word of sympathy or
comfort.  I was still gazing abstractedly at the river,
absorbed in these melancholy thoughts, when footsteps
outside the door and the well-known jangle of keys
aroused me.  I looked round, rather expecting to see
the chaplain, who had promised to pay me a visit in
the course of the day.  It was not the chaplain,
however, who stood before me, when, after sundry
clicking of locks and grating of bolts, the heavy door was
pushed open at last.  The two figures upon whom I
gazed, with dazzled, astonished eyes, were those of
Oliver and Frances Dalrymple.  For a moment I
stood overwhelmed and speechless with surprise, and
Frances also was silent.  Her face was half concealed
by her hood, and her hand was trembling on her
brother's arm.
</p>

<p>
'"Algernon," cried Oliver, grasping my hand
eagerly, "who would have thought of our next
meeting being here?"
</p>

<p>
'"Who indeed?" I gasped out, still in a trance of
bewilderment.  "In sooth, Oliver, I little thought of
our ever meeting again at all; but&mdash;&mdash;"  I paused
and glanced at the graceful little figure clinging to his
side.
</p>

<p>
'"Come, Fan, speak to him.  Tell him the good
news yourself," urged Oliver, looking down at her
with a half smile, and trying to draw her nearer to
me.  "Nay, child, he shall not hear a word from
me.  You have the best right to tell it; and he will
welcome it more from his wife's lips than&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
'"Oliver, how can you be so cruel?" she burst out
impetuously.  "He shall not be kept in this suspense.
My Lord Desmond, you are saved.  The King has
granted you a pardon, and you are free to leave the
Tower whenever it pleases you."
</p>

<p>
'A tumult of mixed feelings came rushing over me
when I looked into her sweet, eager face.  She had
left her brother's arm, and stood before me with a
beautiful crimson flush on her cheeks, and her dark
eyes glistening with tears, as they had done on that
morning of our last, meeting in the Palace.
</p>

<p>
'"Saved! and on Sir Bernard's conditions?" I
stammered out, hardly knowing what I said, while a
cold pang of doubt and fear shot across me.  But I
did not need Oliver's emphatic "No, no; Sir Bernard
has naught to do with it.  'Tis Fan who has managed
all;" for Frances' reproachful eyes had answered my
question, and before her brother had done speaking,
her hands were clasped in mine, and the promise so
lightly spoken in those childish days at Horsemandown
was solemnly repeated now.  Frances and I
were husband and wife, until death us should part.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
'A few weeks after, my wife and I were sailing out
of the mouth of the Thames, on board a vessel bound
for Altona, and Frances, for the first time in her life
looked out upon the sea.  It was with very wistful eyes
that she watched the shores of England growing
fainter and fainter to her sight, for she had never left
them before; and now she was an exile's wife, and
might possibly wander over half the countries of Europe
before she saw her native land again.  The pardon
which she had striven so hard to obtain had not
been granted without the proviso that her husband
should leave the country at once, and for ever; and
without hesitation she had agreed to leave her own
home and kindred and to share the future&mdash;which to
her had once looked so brilliant&mdash;with a man whose
prospects were already sufficiently blighted, but which
without her would be hopelessly dreary indeed.
</p>

<p>
'Sir Bernard was very loth to let her go; but as
the marriage could only have been annulled by our
mutual consent, he had no choice but to be reconciled
to it.  He and I parted good friends; and he showed
far more affection for his daughter, and sorrow at
bidding her farewell, than I had ever believed him
capable of feeling.  But perhaps the hardest matter
to both of us was the saying good-bye to Oliver, who,
on his unexpected return from Holland high in the
King's favour, had done a great deal towards
overcoming his father's dislike to our marriage.  Very
many years passed by before we saw his face again.
</p>

<p>
'It was not until late in Queen Anne's reign that
the sentence of my banishment was reversed, and my
forfeited estates restored.
</p>

<p>
'Need I say that the first days of our return to
England were spent with Sir Oliver Dalrymple, now
the master of Horsemandown, where Frances and I
smiled over the remembrance of our first meeting, and
knelt together once more in the little parish church
which had been the scene of our wedding so very long
ago?'
